      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer:\u001b[0m <P> The central nervous system ( CNS ) is the part of the nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord . The central nervous system is so named because it integrates information it receives from , and coordinates and influences the activity of , all parts of the bodies of bilaterally symmetric animals -- that is , all multicellular animals except sponges and radially symmetric animals such as jellyfish -- and it contains the majority of the nervous system . Many consider the retina and the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , as well as the olfactory nerves ( cranial nerve I ) and olfactory epithelium as parts of the CNS , synapsing directly on brain tissue without intermediate ganglia . As such , the olfactory epithelium is the only central nervous tissue in direct contact with the environment , which opens up for therapeutic treatments . The CNS is contained within the dorsal body cavity , with the brain housed in the cranial cavity and the spinal cord in the spinal canal . In vertebrates , the brain is protected by the skull , while the spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae . The brain and spinal cord are both enclosed in the meninges . In central nervous systems , the interneuronal space is filled with a large amount of supporting non-nervous cells called neuroglial cells . </P>\n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer:\u001b[0m <P> This is a list of host cities of the Olympic Games , both summer and winter , since the modern Olympics began in 1896 . Since then , summer games have usually -- but not always -- celebrated a four - year period known as an Olympiad . There have been 28 Summer Olympic Games held in 24 cities , and 23 Winter Olympic Games held in 20 cities . In addition , three summer and two winter editions of the Games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war : Berlin ( summer ) in 1916 ; Tokyo / Helsinki ( summer ) and Sapporo / Garmisch - Partenkirchen ( winter ) in 1940 ; and London ( summer ) and Cortina d'Ampezzo , Italy ( winter ) in 1944 . The 1906 Summer Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens . However , in 1949 , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games . Four cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games : Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics , Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics , Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics , and Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics . </P>\n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer:\u001b[0m <P> In the early 1960s , the Nashville sound began to be challenged by the rival Bakersfield sound on the country side and by the British Invasion on the pop side ; compounding these problems were the sudden deaths , in separate airplane crashes , of Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves , two of the Nashville Sound 's biggest stars . Nashville 's pop song structure became more pronounced and it morphed into what was called Countrypolitan - a smoother sound typified through the use of lush string arrangements with a real orchestra and often , background vocals provided by a choir . Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s . Among the architects of this sound were producers Billy Sherrill ( who was instrumental in shaping Tammy Wynette 's early career ) and Glenn Sutton . Artists who typified the countrypolitan sound initially included Wynette , Glen Campbell ( who recorded in Hollywood and not Nashville ) , Lynn Anderson , Charlie Rich , and Charley Pride , the latter being a rare example of a top - selling African - American country performer . </P>\n",

      "\u001b[1mQuestion:\u001b[0m who's the director of the price is right\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer:\u001b[0m <P> The game show production team of Mark Goodson and Bill Todman was responsible for producing the original as well as the revival versions of the game show . Goodson - Todman staffer Bob Stewart is credited with creating the original version of The Price Is Right . Roger Dobkowitz was the producer from 1984 to 2008 , having worked with the program as a production staffer since the show 's debut after graduating from San Francisco State University . Occasionally , Dobkowitz appeared on - camera when answering a question posed by the host , usually relating to the show 's history or records . When he left the show at the end of season 36 , Variety reported that it was unclear whether he was retiring or was fired , although Carey indicated in a later interview with Esquire that Dobkowitz was fired . As of 2011 , the show uses multiple producers , all long - time staffers . Adam Sandler ( not to be confused with the actor ) is the producer of the show . Stan Blits , who joined the show in 1980 and Sue MacIntyre are the co-producers . Kathy Greco joined the show in 1975 and became producer in 2008 ; she announced her retirement October 8 , 2010 on the show 's website , effective at the end of the December 2010 tapings . Her last episode as producer , which aired January 27 , 2011 , featured a theme in tribute to her . The show 's official website featured a series of videos including an interview with Greco as a tribute to her 35 years in the days leading up to her final episode . Frank Wayne , a Goodson - Todman staffer since the 1950s , was the original executive producer of the CBS version of the show . Barker assumed that role after Wayne 's death in March 1988 , as previously stated . Previous producers have included Jay Wolpert , Barbara Hunter and Phil Wayne Rossi ( Wayne 's son ) . Michael Dimich assumed the director 's chair in June 2011 . Marc Breslow , Paul Alter , Bart Eskander and Rich DiPirro each served long stints previously as director . Former associate directors Andrew Felsher and Fred Witten , as well as technical director Glenn Koch , have directed episodes strictly on a fill - in basis . Sandler began directing episodes in 2012 , and became the official director in 2013 . Aside from Barker , the show 's production staff remained intact after Carey became host . FremantleMedia executive Syd Vinnedge was named the program 's new executive producer , with Richards becoming co-executive producer after Dobkowitz 's departure . Richards was a candidate to replace Barker as host in 2007 , before Carey was ultimately chosen . Richards succeeded Vinnedge as executive producer when the 2009 -- 10 season started , with Tracy Verna Soiseth joining Richards as co-executive producer in 2010 . Vinnedge remains credited as an executive consultant to the show . </P>\n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer:\u001b[0m <P> In medicine , a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat by trained fingertips . The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body , such as at the neck ( carotid artery ) , wrist ( radial artery ) , at the groin ( femoral artery ) , behind the knee ( popliteal artery ) , near the ankle joint ( posterior tibial artery ) , and on foot ( dorsalis pedis artery ) . Pulse ( or the count of arterial pulse per minute ) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate . The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by auscultation , traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute . The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers . This has a reason : the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure , the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure , and the finger most distal to the heart ( usually the ring finger ) is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches ( superficial and deep ) . The study of the pulse is known as sphygmology . </P>\n",

It began on Friday , 2 April 1982 , when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands ( and , the following day , South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands ) in an attempt to establish the sovereignty it had claimed over them . On 5 April , the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands . The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with the Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982 , returning the islands to British control .

Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . </P>\n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer:\u001b[0m <P> In Europe in the early 15th century the letters `` P '' and `` M '' were generally used . The symbols ( P with line p̄ for più , i.e. , plus , and M with line m̄ for meno , i.e. , minus ) appeared for the first time in Luca Pacioli 's mathematics compendium , Summa de arithmetica , geometria , proportioni et proportionalità , first printed and published in Venice in 1494 . The + is a simplification of the Latin `` et '' ( comparable to the ampersand & ) . The − may be derived from a tilde written over m when used to indicate subtraction ; or it may come from a shorthand version of the letter m itself . In his 1489 treatise Johannes Widmann referred to the symbols − and + as minus and mer ( Modern German mehr ; `` more '' ) : `` was − ist , das ist minus , und das + ist das mer '' . They were n't used for addition and subtraction here , but to indicate surplus and deficit ; their first use in their modern sense appears in a book by Henricus Grammateus in 1518 . </P>\n",

Based on the novel Le Pont de la Rivière Kwai ( 1952 ) by Pierre Boulle , the film is a work of fiction , but borrows the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942 -- 1943 for its historical setting . The movie was filmed in Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) . The bridge in the film was near Kitulgala . </P>\n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer:\u001b[0m <P> In the late 1700s , traffic in the United States was RHT based on teamsters ' use of large freight wagons pulled by several pairs of horses . The wagons had no driver 's seat , so the ( typically right - handed ) postilion held his whip in his right hand and thus sat on the left rear horse . Seated on the left , the driver preferred that other wagons pass him on the left so that he could be sure to keep clear of the wheels of oncoming wagons . </P>\n",

A runner is any non-goalkeeper position player , including forwards , transition players , and defenders . Runners usually specialize in one of these roles and substitute off the field when the ball moves from one end to the other . When the sport originated teams played with six runners .

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer:\u001b[0m <P> The survival of the Acadian settlements was based on successful cooperation with the Indigenous peoples of the region . In the early years of Acadian settlement , this included a small number of recorded marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women . Some records have survived showing marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women in formal Roman Catholic rites , for example , the marriage of Charles La Tour to a Mi'kmaw woman in 1626 . There were also reported instances of Acadian settlers marrying Indigenous spouses according to Mi'kmaq rites , and subsequently living in Mi'kmaq communities . Many settlers also brought French wives with them to Acadia , such as La Tour 's second wife , Françoise - Marie Jacquelin , who joined him in Acadia in 1640 . </P>\n",
