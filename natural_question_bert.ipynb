       "[\" Email marketing is the act of sending a commercial message , typically to a group of people , using email . In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads .   Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns .   Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured .   Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails :   Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts .   The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services .   Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) .   Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used .   Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy .   There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail .   Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons :   As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % .   Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day .   Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy .   Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing .   Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements .   A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter .   With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments .   The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) .   The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses .   In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses .   The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication .   The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission .   In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages .   The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . \"]"

       " '   Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons :   As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers ',\n",
       " ' According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U',\n",
       " 'S',\n",
       " ' ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing ',\n",
       " ' This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % ',\n",
       " '   Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day ',\n",
       " \"   Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy \",\n",
       " '   Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it ',\n",
       " ' This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing ',\n",
       " '   Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver ',\n",
       " ' This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers ',\n",
       " \" If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' \",\n",
       " ' It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer ',\n",
       " ' Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements ',\n",
       " \"   A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers \",\n",
       " ' Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products ',\n",
       " ' In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter ',\n",
       " '   With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing ',\n",
       " ' They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments ',\n",
       " \"   The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' \",\n",
       " ' The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information ',\n",
       " ' Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) ',\n",
       " \"   The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 \",\n",
       " ' CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses ',\n",
       " '   In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications ',\n",
       " ' Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes ',\n",
       " ' The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses ',\n",
       " '   The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states ',\n",
       " ' In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication ',\n",
       " '   The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails ',\n",
       " ' Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them ',\n",
       " ' The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient ',\n",
       " \" However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' \",\n",
       " ' In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling ',\n",
       " ' As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act ',\n",
       " ' A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act ',\n",
       " \" To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission \",\n",
