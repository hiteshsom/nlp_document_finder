      "1) Towns and communities along the Outer Banks include ( listed from north to south ) : \n",
      "\n",
      "2)Outer Banks - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The northern part of the Outer Banks , from Oregon Inlet northward , is actually a part of the North American mainland , since the northern inlets of Bodie Island and Currituck Banks no longer exist . It is separated by the Currituck Sound and the Intracoastal Waterway , which passes through the Great Dismal Swamp occupying much of the mainland west of the Outer Banks . Road access to the northern Outer Banks is cut off between Sandbridge and Corolla , North Carolina , with communities such as Carova Beach accessible only by four - wheel drive vehicles . North Carolina State Highway 12 links most of the popular Outer Banks communities in this section of the coast . The easternmost point is Cape Point at Cape Hatteras on Hatteras Island , site of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Outer Banks ( OBX ) is a 200 - mile - long ( 320 km ) string of barrier islands and spits off the coast of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia , on the east coast of the United States . They cover most of the North Carolina coastline , separating the Currituck Sound , Albemarle Sound , and Pamlico Sound from the Atlantic Ocean . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The abbreviations OBX ( Outer Banks ) and SOBX ( Southern Outer Banks ) are modern terms used to promote tourism and to market a variety of stickers , t - shirts , and other items to vacationers . OBX , which originated first , is generally used in the northern Outer Banks . SOBX is used primarily in Carteret County , which is also known as the Crystal Coast . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Outer Banks stretch southward from Sandbridge in Virginia Beach down the North Carolina coastline . Sources differ regarding the southern terminus of the Outer Banks . Generations of North Carolina schoolchildren have learned that the term includes the state 's three prominent capes : Cape Hatteras , Cape Lookout , and Cape Fear . Other sources limit the definition to two capes ( Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout ) and coastal areas in four counties ( Currituck County , Dare County , Hyde County , and Carteret County ) . Some authors include Carteret 's Shackelford Banks and Bogue Banks in their descriptions , while others exclude Bogue Banks . Still other references restrict the definition to the northern three counties of Currituck , Dare , and Hyde . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The vegetation of the Outer Banks varies . In the northeast part of the Outer Banks , from Virginia Beach southward past the North Carolina border to Oregon Inlet , the main types of vegetation are sea grasses , beach grasses and other beach plants including Opuntia humifusa on the Atlantic side and wax myrtles , bays , and grasses on the Sound side with areas of pine and Spanish moss - covered live oaks . Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa can be found growing wild here in the northern parts of its range on the beach . Sabal Minor palms were once indigenous to the entire Outer Banks , and they are still successfully planted and grown . Its current most northerly known native stand is on Monkey Island in Currituck County . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) From Cape Hatteras National Seashore southward , the vegetation does include that of the northeastern Outer Banks such as Sabal minor , Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa ; however , the main vegetation consists of Cabbage palmetto ( Sabal palmetto ) , which can be found in the north , although they are native in the southern part of the Outer Banks , specifically prevalent from Cape Hatteras and all points southward . Pindo palms and windmill palms are also planted widely throughout the Outer Banks ; although , they are not indigenous to the area . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Before bridges were built in the 1930s , the only form of transport between or off the islands was by boat , which allowed for the islands to stay isolated from much of the rest of the mainland . This helped to preserve the maritime culture and the distinctive Outer Banks accent or brogue , which sounds more like an English accent than it does an American accent . Many `` bankers '' have often been mistaken for being from England or Ireland when traveling to areas outside of the Outer Banks . The brogue is more distinctive the further south one travels on the Outer Banks , with it being the thickest on Ocracoke Island and Harkers Island . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The Outer Banks is a string of peninsulas and barrier islands separating the Atlantic Ocean from mainland North Carolina . From north to south , the largest of these include : Bodie Island ( which used to be an island but is now a peninsula due to tropical storms and hurricanes ) , Hatteras Island , Ocracoke Island , Portsmouth Island , and the Core Banks . Over time , the exact number of islands and inlets changes as new inlets are opened up , often during a breach created during violent storms , and older inlets close , usually due to gradually sifting sands during the dynamic processes of beach evolution . \n",

      "1) Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : \n",
      "\n",
      "3)Email marketing - Wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Email marketing is the act of sending a commercial message , typically to a group of people , using email . In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . \n",

      "\n",
      "2) Tracy McConnell , better known as `` The Mother '' , is the title character from the CBS television sitcom How I Met Your Mother . The show , narrated by Future Ted , tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother . Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in `` Something New '' and was promoted to a main character in season 9 . The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Later , in `` Girls Versus Suits '' , Ted dates Cindy , not knowing that her roommate is his future wife . Throughout the episode , Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate . When in Cindy and the mother 's apartment he picks up many of The Mother 's belongings , attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are ( thinking the items are Cindy 's ) and glimpses the mother 's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower . Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band . Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions , `` this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back . '' In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is revealed that , after Ted left the apartment , the Mother had discovered the umbrella and , upon going to question Cindy , finds her in a state . As she tried to console her , Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted , and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive , before spontaneously kissing her , revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush . While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian , it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating , as the kiss was her first in a long time . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Mother , joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death . After the funeral service , she returns to the apartment to open Max 's last gift to her -- a ukulele . The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) In the series finale , it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children , Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness . In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead . Ted says that she `` became sick '' and his children saying that she has been `` gone '' for six years . Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother 's death . Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die , but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning . Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was `` an amazing character '' and that `` over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy . Kuchman said that `` asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request '' , that the finale `` advanced too quickly '' and that `` HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In a flashforward in `` The Lighthouse '' , Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn . She immediately accepts . In another flashfoward in `` Unpause '' , the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child , Luke , in the year 2017 . She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series , including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment . Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky 's wedding ; this scene is shown in `` Last Forever '' , the series finale . The Mother 's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024 , also revealed in the series finale , received a mixed reaction from fans . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The Mother meets all of Ted 's best friends ( Barney , Lily , Marshall and Robin ) before she meets him . The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin , as revealed through a flashback in `` Platonish '' . In `` The Locket '' , Tracy meets Lily on a train journey . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The Mother 's real name is not revealed until the series finale , `` Last Forever '' . When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station , she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell . In the season 1 episode `` Belly Full of Turkey '' , Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says `` ... that , kids , is the true story of how I met your mother '' . The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking , which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother 's name is Tracy . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The Mother is first shown meeting Louis in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now - lead band member Darren talks to his fans . Later at MacLaren 's Pub , she tells him she 's not yet ready to date . Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after . \n",

      "1)Human fertilization - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm , usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell , or fertilized egg , initiating prenatal development . Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Usually 23 chromosomes from spermatozoon and 23 chromosomes from egg cell fuse ( half of spermatozoons carry X chromosome and the other half Y chromosome ) . Their membranes dissolve , leaving no barriers between the male and female chromosomes . During this dissolution , a mitotic spindle forms between them . The spindle captures the chromosomes before they disperse in the egg cytoplasm . Upon subsequently undergoing mitosis ( which includes pulling of chromatids towards centrioles in anaphase ) the cell gathers genetic material from the male and female together . Thus , the first mitosis of the union of sperm and oocyte is the actual fusion of their chromosomes . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The sperm 's tail and mitochondria degenerate with the formation of the male pronucleus . This is why all mitochondria in humans are of maternal origin . Still , a considerable amount of RNA from the sperm is delivered to the resulting embryo and likely influences embryo development and the phenotype of the offspring . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The sperm binds through the corona radiata , a layer of follicle cells on the outside of the secondary oocyte . Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell , known as zygote . The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The oocyte completes its second meiotic division . This results in a mature ovum . The nucleus of the oocyte is called a pronucleus in this process , to distinguish it from the nuclei that are the result of fertilization . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) After the sperm enters the cytoplasm of the oocyte ( also called ovocyte ) , the tail and the outer coating of the sperm disintegrate and the cortical reaction takes place , preventing other sperm from fertilizing the same egg . The oocyte now undergoes its second meiotic division producing the haploid ovum and releasing a polar body . The sperm nucleus then fuses with the ovum , enabling fusion of their genetic material . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Some sperm cells consume their acrosome prematurely on the surface of the egg cell , facilitating the penetration by other sperm cells . As a population , sperm cells have on average 50 % genome similarity so the premature acrosomal reactions aid fertilization by a member of the same cohort . It may be regarded as a mechanism of kin selection . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Once the sperm cells find their way past the zona pellucida , the cortical reaction occurs . Cortical granules inside the secondary oocyte fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell , causing enzymes inside these granules to be expelled by exocytosis to the zona pellucida . This in turn causes the glyco - proteins in the zona pellucida to cross-link with each other -- i.e. the enzymes cause the ZP2 to hydrolyse into ZP2f -- making the whole matrix hard and impermeable to sperm . This prevents fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm . The cortical reaction and acrosome reaction are both essential to ensure that only one sperm will fertilize an egg . \n",

      "1)Roanoke Colony - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) John Lawson wrote in his 1709 work A New Voyage to Carolina that the Croatans living on Hatteras Island used to live on Roanoke Island and claimed to have white ancestors : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Once the Jamestown settlement was established in 1607 , efforts were undertaken by the English to acquire information from the Powhatan tribe about Roanoke . The first definitive information concerning the fate of the Lost Colony came from Captain John Smith , leader of the Jamestown Colony from 1608 to 1609 . According to chronicler Samuel Purchas , Smith learned from Chief Powhatan that he had personally conducted the slaughter of the Roanoke colonists just prior to the arrival of the Jamestown settlers because they were living with the Chesepians , a tribe living in the eastern portion of the present - day South Hampton Roads sub-region who were related to the Pamlico tribe in Carolina and who refused to merge with the Powhatans . This shocking information was reported to England and by the spring of 1609 , King James and the Royal Council were convinced that Chief Powhatan was responsible for the slaughter of the Lost Colony . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The colonists disappeared during the Anglo - Spanish War , three years after the last shipment of supplies from England . Their disappearance gave rise to the nickname `` The Lost Colony '' . There is no conclusive evidence as to what happened to the colonists . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) However , the case was far from settled . A similar legend claims that the now extinct Saponi of Person County , North Carolina , are descended from the English colonists of Roanoke Island . However , no documented evidence exists to link the Saponi to the Roanoke colonists . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Harriot reports that relations between the Roanoke Indians and the English settlers were mutually calm and prosperous , contradicting other historical evidence that catalogs the bloody struggles between the Roanoke Indians and both of Raleigh 's commanders , Sir Richard Grenville and his successor , Ralph Lane . Harriot recounts little to none of these accounts in his report to England and does not mention the disorderly state of the colony under either Grenville 's or Lane 's tenure , correctly assuming these facts would prevent Roanoke from gaining more settlers . Harriot 's text did not reach England , or the English press , until 1588 , by which time the fate of the `` Lost Colony '' was sealed in all but name . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The Roanoke Colony ( / ˈroʊəˌnoʊk / ) , also known as the Lost Colony , was established in 1585 on Roanoke Island in what is today 's Dare County , North Carolina . It was a late 16th - century attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent English settlement in North America . The colony was founded by Sir Walter Raleigh . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In 1587 , Raleigh dispatched a new group of 115 colonists to establish a colony on Chesapeake Bay . They were led by John White , an artist and friend of Raleigh who had accompanied the previous expedition to Roanoke , and was appointed governor of the 1587 colony . White and Raleigh named 12 assistants to aid in the settlement . They were ordered to stop at Roanoke to pick up the small contingent left there by Grenville the previous year , but when they arrived on July 22 , 1587 , they found nothing except a skeleton that may have been the remains of one of the English garrison . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Between their arrival in Roanoke in April 1585 and the July 1586 departure , Harriot and White both conducted detailed studies of the Roanoke area , with Harriot compiling his samples and notes into several notebooks that did not survive the colony 's disappearance . Harriot also wrote descriptions of the surrounding flora and fauna of the area , which survive in his work A Brief and True Report of the New Founde Land of Virginia , written as a report on the colony 's progress to the English government on the request of Raleigh . Viewed by modern historians as propaganda for the colony , this work has become vastly important to Roanoke 's history due to Harriot 's observations on wildlife as well as his depictions of Indian activities at the time of the colony 's disappearance . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The researchers concluded that the settlers of the Lost Colony landed at Roanoke Island in the summer of the worst growing - season drought in 800 years . `` This drought persisted for 3 years , from 1587 to 1589 , and is the driest 3 - year episode in the entire 800 - year reconstruction , '' the team reported in the journal Science . A map shows that `` the Lost Colony drought affected the entire southeastern United States but was particularly severe in the Tidewater region near Roanoke ( Island ) . '' The authors suggested that the Croatan who were shot and killed by the colonists may have been scavenging the abandoned village for food as a result of the drought . \n",

      "1) Pom Klementieff ( born 3 May 1986 ) is a French actress . She was trained at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris and has appeared in such films as Loup ( 2009 ) , Sleepless Night ( 2011 ) and Hacker 's Game ( 2015 ) . She plays the role of Mantis in the film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ( 2017 ) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers : Infinity War ( 2018 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Klementieff moved to Los Angeles after Oldboy was filmed and began pursuing more Hollywood auditions . She continued taekwondo after the film , and has a purple belt as of the summer of 2014 . Her next acting role was the film Hacker 's Game ( 2015 ) , in which she plays a hacker she compared to Lisbeth Salander from the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo . Klementieff used her boxing skills again in the film , and due to the movie 's low budget , she had to do her own make - up and chose her own wardrobe . It was her idea to dye her hair purple for the role , to which the directors first objected but later acquiesced . She joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe with her role as Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ( 2017 ) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers : Infinity War ( 2018 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Klementieff made her Hollywood debut in Spike Lee 's Oldboy ( 2013 ) , a remake of the South Korean film of the same name . She portrayed Haeng - Bok , the bodyguard of the antagonist played by Sharlto Copley . A fan of the original film , Klementieff heard about the part through Roy Lee , a producer with the remake , and took boxing lessons after learning the role involved martial arts . After showcasing her boxing skills during her audition , Lee asked her to go home and come back wearing a more feminine outfit and make - up , like her character in the film . She contributed some of her own clothes to the character 's wardrobe , and trained three hours a day for two months for an on - screen fight with star Josh Brolin . Klementieff came up with the name Haeng - Bok , Korean for `` happiness '' , herself after Lee asked her to research possible names for the character . \n",
      "\n",
      "4)Pom Klementieff - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Klementieff 's first professional acting job was the French independent film Après lui ( 2007 ) , portraying the stepdaughter of the protagonist played by Catherine Deneuve . Filming for her scenes took three days . During one scene , Klementieff was supposed to push someone down a set of stairs but accidentally fell down the stairs herself , and director Gaël Morel kept that shot in the final film . Her first leading role was in Loup ( 2009 ) , a French film about a tribe of reindeer herders in the Siberian mountains . During filming , Klementieff stayed in a camp , hours from the nearest village , where temperatures dropped well below zero . During filming she befriended nomads who lived there , worked with real wolves , rode reindeer , and swam with a horse in a lake . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Pom Klementieff was born in Quebec City , Quebec , Canada , to a Korean mother and French - Russian father , who was working there as a consul with the French government . She had a brother who committed suicide . Her parents chose the name `` Pom '' because it is similar in pronunciation to the Korean words for both `` spring '' ( 봄 ) and `` tiger '' ( 범 ) . Klementieff lived in Canada for one year before her family traveled extensively due to her father 's job , and she lived in Japan and the Ivory Coast before settling in France . Klementieff later said that travelling at an early age gave her a `` gypsy soul '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Klementieff 's father died of cancer when she was 5 , and her mother was schizophrenic and unable to care for children , so Klementieff was raised by her paternal uncle and aunt . Her uncle , whom she described as `` like my second father '' , died on her 18th birthday . Klementieff briefly attended law school after her uncle 's death to appease her aunt , but did not find the career path appealing . She also worked as a waitress and saleswoman in France . She started acting at age 19 at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris . A few months into her education , she won a theater competition that awarded her free classes for two years with the school 's top teachers . \n",

Among them is a redeemed Professor Hinkle , who is proudly wearing his new top hat . At the end of the parade , Frosty gets back into Santa 's waiting sleigh and they return to the North Pole , with Frosty proclaiming , `` I 'll be back on Christmas Day ! '' \n",

      "4) Hocus brings Santa Claus to the greenhouse only to find Karen in tears and Frosty melted on the floor due to Hinkle 's cruel act . Santa explains to Karen that Frosty is made from Christmas snow , and that he can never completely disappear , only take the form of summer rain , until next December . With a gust of cold wind through the open greenhouse door , the puddle that was Frosty blows out the door and magically changes back into his typical snowman form . Before Santa can put the finishing touch on Frosty and bring him back to life , as Hocus arrives with the hat , Hinkle arrives on the scene and again demands the return of his hat . He relents only when threatened with being removed from Santa 's Christmas list for the rest of his life if he put so much as one finger on the hat . Santa states that if Hinkle is truly repentant for his mean attitude and harming Frosty , and if he goes home and writes `` I am really sorry for what I did to Frosty '' a hundred zillion times , he may find a gift in his stocking on Christmas morning , which makes Hinkle bid Frosty and Karen farewell and run home to repeatedly write his apologies , assuming he may get a new hat . Finally , Santa then places the magic hat back on top of Frosty 's head , and the snowman returns to life again . After celebrating , Santa takes Karen home and Frosty to the North Pole , but promises that Frosty will be back next winter . \n",

      "5) One December afternoon , a little girl named Karen and her friends create a snowman after a class Christmas party at school . After several suggestions of what to call their snowman ( including `` Oatmeal '' and `` Christopher Columbus '' ) , Karen decides to name him `` Frosty . '' Later , the children acquire a top hat discarded by inept magician Professor Hinkle . Karen places the hat on top of Frosty 's head , and the snowman comes to life ( and always says `` Happy Birthday ! '' in response ) . When Hinkle learns of the magic power his hat actually possesses , he takes it back and departs , pretending that he did not see Frosty come to life . However , the professor 's pet rabbit , Hocus Pocus , returns the hat to Frosty and the children . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Frosty the Snowman is a 1969 animated Christmas television special based on the song `` Frosty the Snowman '' . The program , which first aired on December 7 , 1969 on CBS ( where it continues to air annually ) , was produced for television by Rankin / Bass Productions and featured the voices of comedians Jimmy Durante as the film 's narrator ( Durante 's final performance in a film ) and Jackie Vernon as the title character . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Family Home Entertainment released Frosty the Snowman on VHS as part of the Christmas Classics Series in 1989 and 1993 , with multiple re-prints throughout the 1990s . It was paired with The Little Drummer Boy on LaserDisc in 1992 . Upon its 1989 and 1993 releases , the special was also bundled in box sets with the other Rankin / Bass Christmas specials including Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer and Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town , the 1973 Chuck Jones holiday special , A Very Merry Cricket and the sequel Frosty Returns which aired on CBS in 1992 . In 1998 , Sony Wonder and Golden Books Family Entertainment released the special on VHS , and also paired it with these other Rankin / Bass Christmas specials including Cricket on the Hearth in the separate Holiday Classics Collection box sets . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Frosty soon senses the temperature is rising and worries about melting away . The children suggest putting him on the next train to the North Pole , where he will never melt , and they all parade into the city on the way to the train station , where Frosty has his confrontation with the traffic cop mentioned in the song 's lyrics . When Karen explains that Frosty came to life and does n't know what a traffic light or a lamp post is , the traffic cop lets Frosty go . At the train station , Frosty stows away aboard a refrigerated train car , since neither he nor the children have any money for a train ticket . As the train is about to leave the station , Karen and Hocus decide to join Frosty for the ride to keep him company . With that , Frosty , Karen , and Hocus wave goodbye to the other kids as the train takes off . Unbeknownst to them , Hinkle has also hitched a ride on the train , intending to get his hat back . \n",

      "9) Released by Rhino on October 1 , 2002 , the entire audio portion of Frosty the Snowman is available on CD along with the entire audio portion of Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town , the Rankin / Bass special produced in 1970 . This edition contains the full dialogue and song audio of both specials . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) As the train continues up north , however , Frosty notices Karen is freezing and starting to catch a cold , so they jump off the train , leaving Hinkle behind once again . Hinkle , seeing them escape , jumps off the train too , but falls down a mountain and crashes into a tree where a pile of snow falls on him . At Frosty 's request , Hocus convinces some forest animals who are preparing for Christmas to build a campfire for Karen . Fearing that Karen still can not survive for long in the cold weather , Frosty asks Hocus who might be able to help them . Hocus suggests ( by pantomiming ) the President of the United States and the United States Marines , before suggesting Santa Claus . Frosty agrees , and promptly takes credit for the idea himself ( much to Hocus ' annoyance ) . Hocus hops off to get Santa , but Hinkle then confronts Frosty and Karen once more and blows out Karen 's campfire . Frosty and Karen are again forced to flee , this time with Karen riding on Frosty 's back as he slides head - first down a hill . At the bottom of the slope , Karen and Frosty discover a greenhouse filled with Christmas poinsettias . Despite Karen 's objections , Frosty steps inside the warm greenhouse with her , suggesting that he could afford to lose a little weight while she warms up . Unfortunately , an angry and vengeful Hinkle catches up to them immediately after and locks them in the greenhouse . \n",

      "1) The survival of the Acadian settlements was based on successful cooperation with the Indigenous peoples of the region . In the early years of Acadian settlement , this included a small number of recorded marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women . Some records have survived showing marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women in formal Roman Catholic rites , for example , the marriage of Charles La Tour to a Mi'kmaw woman in 1626 . There were also reported instances of Acadian settlers marrying Indigenous spouses according to Mi'kmaq rites , and subsequently living in Mi'kmaq communities . Many settlers also brought French wives with them to Acadia , such as La Tour 's second wife , Françoise - Marie Jacquelin , who joined him in Acadia in 1640 . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) There was already a long history of Acadian and Wabanaki Confederacy resistance to the British occupation of Acadia during the four French and Indian Wars and two local wars ( Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) before the Expulsion of the Acadians . The Mi'kmaq and the Acadians were allies through Catholicism and through numerous inter-marriages . The Mi'kmaq held the military strength in Acadia even after the conquest of 1710 . They primarily resisted the British occupation of Acadia and were joined in their efforts on numerous occasions by Acadians . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The history of the Acadians was significantly influenced by the six colonial wars that took place in Acadia during the 17th and 18th century ( see the four French and Indian Wars , Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) . Eventually , the last of the colonial wars -- the French and Indian War -- resulted in the British Expulsion of the Acadians from the region . After the war , many Acadians came out of hiding or returned to Acadia from the British Colonies . Others remained in France and some migrated from there to Louisiana , where they became known as Cajuns , a corruption of the word Acadiens or Acadians . The nineteenth century saw the beginning of the Acadian Renaissance and the publication of Evangeline , which helped galvanize Acadian identity . In the last century Acadians have made achievements in the areas of equal language and cultural rights as a minority group in the Maritime provinces of Canada . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) While many Acadians traded with the New England Protestants , Acadians ' participation in the wars clearly indicated that many were reluctant to be ruled by the British . During the first colonial war , King William 's War ( 1688 -- 97 ) , the crews of the very successful French privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste were primarily Acadian . The Acadians resisted during the Raid on Chignecto ( 1696 ) . During Queen Anne 's War , Mi'kmaq and Acadians resisted during the Raid on Grand Pré , Piziquid and Chignecto in 1704 . The Acadians also assisted the French in protecting the capital in the Siege of Port Royal ( 1707 ) and the final Conquest of Acadia . The Acadians and Mi'kmaq were also successful in the Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1711 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) After the end of the Seven Years ' War in 1763 , Acadians were allowed to return to Nova Scotia as long as they did not settle in any one area in large numbers ; they were not permitted to resettle in the areas of Port Royal or Grand - Pré . Some Acadians resettled along the Nova Scotia coast and remain scattered across Nova Scotia to this day . Many dispersed Acadians looked for other homes . Beginning in 1764 , groups of Acadians began to arrive in Louisiana ( which had passed to Spanish control in 1762 ) . They eventually became known as Cajuns . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Some Acadians escaped into the woods and lived with the Mi'kmaq ; some bands of partisans fought the British , including a group led by Joseph Broussard , known as `` Beausoleil '' , along the Petitcodiac River of New Brunswick . Some followed the coast northward , facing famine and disease . Some were recaptured , facing deportation or imprisonment at Fort Beausejour ( renamed Fort Cumberland ) until 1763 . \n",

      "9) Kennedy ( 2014 ) argues that the emigrants from the Vienne region of France carried to Acadia their customs and social structure . They were frontier people , who dispersed their settlements based on kinship . They optimized use of farmland and emphasized trading for a profit . They were hierarchical and politically active . The French and the Acadian villages were similar in terms of prosperity , egalitarianism , and independent - mindedness . Kennedy says the emergence of a distinct Acadian identity emerged from the gradual adaptation of traditional French methods , institutions , and ideas to the North American environmental and political situations . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Beginning in the 1770s , many Acadians were encouraged to return through the policies of Nova Scotia Governor Michael Francklin , who guaranteed Catholic worship , land grants and issued a promise that there would be no second expulsion ( At this time , Nova Scotia included present - day New Brunswick ) . However the fertile Acadian dykelands had been resettled by New England Planters , who were soon followed by Loyalists who further occupied former Acadian lands . Returning Acadians and those families who had escaped expulsion had to settle in other parts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick , in most cases isolated and infertile lands . The new Acadian settlements were forced to focus more on fishery and later forestry . \n",

      "1) Towns and communities along the Outer Banks include ( listed from north to south ) : \n",
      "\n",
      "2)Outer Banks - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The northern part of the Outer Banks , from Oregon Inlet northward , is actually a part of the North American mainland , since the northern inlets of Bodie Island and Currituck Banks no longer exist . It is separated by the Currituck Sound and the Intracoastal Waterway , which passes through the Great Dismal Swamp occupying much of the mainland west of the Outer Banks . Road access to the northern Outer Banks is cut off between Sandbridge and Corolla , North Carolina , with communities such as Carova Beach accessible only by four - wheel drive vehicles . North Carolina State Highway 12 links most of the popular Outer Banks communities in this section of the coast . The easternmost point is Cape Point at Cape Hatteras on Hatteras Island , site of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Outer Banks ( OBX ) is a 200 - mile - long ( 320 km ) string of barrier islands and spits off the coast of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia , on the east coast of the United States . They cover most of the North Carolina coastline , separating the Currituck Sound , Albemarle Sound , and Pamlico Sound from the Atlantic Ocean . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The abbreviations OBX ( Outer Banks ) and SOBX ( Southern Outer Banks ) are modern terms used to promote tourism and to market a variety of stickers , t - shirts , and other items to vacationers . OBX , which originated first , is generally used in the northern Outer Banks . SOBX is used primarily in Carteret County , which is also known as the Crystal Coast . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Outer Banks stretch southward from Sandbridge in Virginia Beach down the North Carolina coastline . Sources differ regarding the southern terminus of the Outer Banks . Generations of North Carolina schoolchildren have learned that the term includes the state 's three prominent capes : Cape Hatteras , Cape Lookout , and Cape Fear . Other sources limit the definition to two capes ( Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout ) and coastal areas in four counties ( Currituck County , Dare County , Hyde County , and Carteret County ) . Some authors include Carteret 's Shackelford Banks and Bogue Banks in their descriptions , while others exclude Bogue Banks . Still other references restrict the definition to the northern three counties of Currituck , Dare , and Hyde . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The vegetation of the Outer Banks varies . In the northeast part of the Outer Banks , from Virginia Beach southward past the North Carolina border to Oregon Inlet , the main types of vegetation are sea grasses , beach grasses and other beach plants including Opuntia humifusa on the Atlantic side and wax myrtles , bays , and grasses on the Sound side with areas of pine and Spanish moss - covered live oaks . Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa can be found growing wild here in the northern parts of its range on the beach . Sabal Minor palms were once indigenous to the entire Outer Banks , and they are still successfully planted and grown . Its current most northerly known native stand is on Monkey Island in Currituck County . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) From Cape Hatteras National Seashore southward , the vegetation does include that of the northeastern Outer Banks such as Sabal minor , Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa ; however , the main vegetation consists of Cabbage palmetto ( Sabal palmetto ) , which can be found in the north , although they are native in the southern part of the Outer Banks , specifically prevalent from Cape Hatteras and all points southward . Pindo palms and windmill palms are also planted widely throughout the Outer Banks ; although , they are not indigenous to the area . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Before bridges were built in the 1930s , the only form of transport between or off the islands was by boat , which allowed for the islands to stay isolated from much of the rest of the mainland . This helped to preserve the maritime culture and the distinctive Outer Banks accent or brogue , which sounds more like an English accent than it does an American accent . Many `` bankers '' have often been mistaken for being from England or Ireland when traveling to areas outside of the Outer Banks . The brogue is more distinctive the further south one travels on the Outer Banks , with it being the thickest on Ocracoke Island and Harkers Island . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The Outer Banks is a string of peninsulas and barrier islands separating the Atlantic Ocean from mainland North Carolina . From north to south , the largest of these include : Bodie Island ( which used to be an island but is now a peninsula due to tropical storms and hurricanes ) , Hatteras Island , Ocracoke Island , Portsmouth Island , and the Core Banks . Over time , the exact number of islands and inlets changes as new inlets are opened up , often during a breach created during violent storms , and older inlets close , usually due to gradually sifting sands during the dynamic processes of beach evolution . \n",

      "1) The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . \n",

      "1) In the season 8 episode `` Band or DJ ? , '' Ted runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute . The end result of the encounter is that Cindy 's ( now ex - ) roommate 's band plays at Barney and Robin 's wedding . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) A petition was started , aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale . The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage . On April 5 , 2014 , Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD . No new material was shot for this scene . In the alternate ending , the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Some time after this , a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics . Darren gradually takes over the band . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) In the season 6 opener `` Big Days '' it is revealed Ted meets his future wife `` the day of '' the wedding at which he is the best man . In the episode `` False Positive '' Robin asks Ted to be her future best man , should she ever get married . In the episode `` Challenge Accepted '' , it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney 's wedding . In the last episode of season 7 , `` The Magician 's Code '' it is shown that Barney will marry Robin , and Ted will meet the mother `` the day of '' their wedding . On the premiere of season 8 , Ted 's wife appears after Barney and Robin 's wedding , outside at the `` Farhampton '' station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) During its first eight seasons , the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother . Well - known actresses often made guest appearances on the show . Many fans expected that another would play one of the most - wanted roles in Hollywood , but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown . Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples , Thomas said that `` We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience '' , similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had `` kept the show alive '' when it began . Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once ; her musical ability was also helpful , as The Mother had been described as a band member . After competing for the role against at least two others , Milioti filmed her first scene -- for the last episode of season 8 -- having never watched How I Met Your Mother ; she recalled , `` I had ignorance on my side . So I did n't know what it meant . '' Milioti learned of the character 's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In `` Wait for It '' , it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella . In `` No Tomorrow '' , Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick 's Day party which she also attended , as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max , her late boyfriend . She is still grieving , but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again , bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating . The two women run into Mitch , her old orchestra instructor ; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment . After they start talking , Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams . The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The Mother was born on September 19 , 1984 . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is shown that after this incident , the Mother returns to Louis ' summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend . As she walks in the door , Louis proposes to her , but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes . She declines Louis ' proposal and leaves his cottage , going to check in at Farhampton Inn . On her room 's balcony , she plays the ukulele and sings `` La Vie en Rose '' . Ted hears her singing from his room next door . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD . In the alternate ending , Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . In the video , future Ted is heard saying , `` ... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning , I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was ... '' , indirectly stating that The Mother is alive . The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling , implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby . \n",

      "\n",
      "3) In preparation for the fusion of their genetic material both the oocyte and the sperm undergo transformations as a reaction to the fusion of cell membranes . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The pronuclei migrate toward the center of the oocyte , rapidly replicating their DNA as they do so to prepare the zygote for its first mitotic division . \n",

      "5) The fusion of cell membranes of the secondary oocyte and sperm takes place . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Various disorders can arise from defects in the fertilization process . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Where the spermatozoon is about to pierce , the yolk ( ooplasm ) is drawn out into a conical elevation , termed the cone of attraction or reception cone . Once the spermatozoon has entered , the peripheral portion of the yolk changes into a membrane , the perivitelline membrane , which prevents the passage of additional spermatozoa . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb , in vitro . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Fertilization age is sometimes used postnatally ( after birth ) as well to estimate various risk factors . For example , it is a better predictor than postnatal age for risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature babies treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation . \n",

      "4) Some residents of the Outer Banks , known as wreckers , made part of their living by scavenging wrecked ships -- or by luring ships to their destruction . Horses with lanterns tied to their necks would be walked along the beach ; the lanterns ' up and down motion would appear to ships to represent clear water and a ship ahead ; the unsuspecting captain would then drive his ship ashore following this false light . \n",

      "5) The Wright brothers ' first flight in a controlled , powered , heavier - than - air vehicle took place on the Outer Banks on December 17 , 1903 , at Kill Devil Hills near the seafront town of Kitty Hawk . The Wright Brothers National Monument commemorates the historic flights , and First Flight Airport is a small , general - aviation airfield located there . \n",

      "6) Archeologists believe that the Outer Banks were inhabited for well over a thousand years before the arrival of Europeans , with small branches of larger tribes , such as Algonquins , Chowanog , and Poteskeet , setting up homes all along the barrier islands from Corolla to Hatteras . European explorers to the Outer Banks as far back as the 1500s noted encountering the friendly Hatteras Island and Outer Banks natives , noting their hospitality to foreign explorers as well as their happiness and overall quality of life . European - borne diseases and migration to the mainland were likely the main causes for the decline of the native population . \n",

      "7) The Outer Banks are a popular destination for bottom fish like spot and mullet , these two types of fish are caught throughout the year . The peak for fishing bottom and top water feeders is early to the middle of May . If the angler is solely searching for top water fish , then late May and June would be the ideal time to fish , especially if they are searching for Mackerel . In the offseason , or winter months , the true fishermen are out searching for Trout , Sea Bass , Bluefish , Bluefin Tuna , Oysters , King Mackerel , Bay Scallops , and Striped Bass . In the spring , the popular catches are Grouper , Sea Trout , Sea Bass , Bluefish , Bluefin and Yellowfin tuna , Oysters , Snapper , Striped Bass , Red Drum , Croaker , Sea Mullet , King Mackerel , and Wahoo Late Spring and the beginning of summer is the favored time for top - water fish to move into the coastal waters near the Outer Banks , because of the warming waters and the increased visibility in the water The top water fish can see baitfish easily due to the decrease in murky water Plus they will start to migrate back North as the coastal waters to the south become too hot , the waters farther North will warm to their desired temperatures . Yet , in the prime tourist season of the summer , fishermen and many tourists have plenty of game options such as blue Marlin , White Marlin , Dolphin , Wahoo , Cobia , King Mackerel , Bluefish , Tuna , Flounder , snapper , Grouper , Spanish Mackerel , Crabs , Soft Crabs , Shrimp , Spot , Croaker , Sailfish , and Sea Mullet . By the fall , most tourists have started to leave , but fishermen are still out searching for Snapper , Channel Bass , Bluefish , King Mackerel , Grouper , Tuna , Oysters , Striped Bass , Sea Mullet , Spot , Clams , Speckled Trout , Flounder , and Shrimp . The prime season for fall fishing is late September to October 23 . Though the water is more turbulent and murky due to the strong northeast prevailing winds , there is still some big game fish left . Most of these fish are vacating back to the South for the warm waters . This makes it a prime time for smaller bottom fish who love to feed in murky , colder water . \n",

      "8) A wide variety of native plants can be found at the Elizabethan Gardens in Manteo on Roanoke Island . The gardens are open year round , 7 days a week . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The islands are home to herds of feral horses , sometimes called `` banker ponies , '' which according to local legend are descended from Spanish Mustangs washed ashore centuries ago in shipwrecks . Populations are found on Ocracoke Island , Shackleford Banks , Currituck Banks , and in the Rachel Carson Estuarine Sanctuary . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The English Roanoke Colony -- where Virginia Dare was born -- vanished from Roanoke Island in 1587 . The Lost Colony , written and performed to commemorate the original colonists , is the second longest running outdoor drama in the United States and its theater acts as a cultural focal point for much of the Outer Banks . \n",
