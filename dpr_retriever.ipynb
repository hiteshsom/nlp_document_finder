      "1) Towns and communities along the Outer Banks include ( listed from north to south ) : \n",
      "\n",
      "2)Outer Banks - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The northern part of the Outer Banks , from Oregon Inlet northward , is actually a part of the North American mainland , since the northern inlets of Bodie Island and Currituck Banks no longer exist . It is separated by the Currituck Sound and the Intracoastal Waterway , which passes through the Great Dismal Swamp occupying much of the mainland west of the Outer Banks . Road access to the northern Outer Banks is cut off between Sandbridge and Corolla , North Carolina , with communities such as Carova Beach accessible only by four - wheel drive vehicles . North Carolina State Highway 12 links most of the popular Outer Banks communities in this section of the coast . The easternmost point is Cape Point at Cape Hatteras on Hatteras Island , site of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Outer Banks ( OBX ) is a 200 - mile - long ( 320 km ) string of barrier islands and spits off the coast of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia , on the east coast of the United States . They cover most of the North Carolina coastline , separating the Currituck Sound , Albemarle Sound , and Pamlico Sound from the Atlantic Ocean . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The abbreviations OBX ( Outer Banks ) and SOBX ( Southern Outer Banks ) are modern terms used to promote tourism and to market a variety of stickers , t - shirts , and other items to vacationers . OBX , which originated first , is generally used in the northern Outer Banks . SOBX is used primarily in Carteret County , which is also known as the Crystal Coast . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Outer Banks stretch southward from Sandbridge in Virginia Beach down the North Carolina coastline . Sources differ regarding the southern terminus of the Outer Banks . Generations of North Carolina schoolchildren have learned that the term includes the state 's three prominent capes : Cape Hatteras , Cape Lookout , and Cape Fear . Other sources limit the definition to two capes ( Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout ) and coastal areas in four counties ( Currituck County , Dare County , Hyde County , and Carteret County ) . Some authors include Carteret 's Shackelford Banks and Bogue Banks in their descriptions , while others exclude Bogue Banks . Still other references restrict the definition to the northern three counties of Currituck , Dare , and Hyde . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The vegetation of the Outer Banks varies . In the northeast part of the Outer Banks , from Virginia Beach southward past the North Carolina border to Oregon Inlet , the main types of vegetation are sea grasses , beach grasses and other beach plants including Opuntia humifusa on the Atlantic side and wax myrtles , bays , and grasses on the Sound side with areas of pine and Spanish moss - covered live oaks . Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa can be found growing wild here in the northern parts of its range on the beach . Sabal Minor palms were once indigenous to the entire Outer Banks , and they are still successfully planted and grown . Its current most northerly known native stand is on Monkey Island in Currituck County . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) From Cape Hatteras National Seashore southward , the vegetation does include that of the northeastern Outer Banks such as Sabal minor , Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa ; however , the main vegetation consists of Cabbage palmetto ( Sabal palmetto ) , which can be found in the north , although they are native in the southern part of the Outer Banks , specifically prevalent from Cape Hatteras and all points southward . Pindo palms and windmill palms are also planted widely throughout the Outer Banks ; although , they are not indigenous to the area . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Before bridges were built in the 1930s , the only form of transport between or off the islands was by boat , which allowed for the islands to stay isolated from much of the rest of the mainland . This helped to preserve the maritime culture and the distinctive Outer Banks accent or brogue , which sounds more like an English accent than it does an American accent . Many `` bankers '' have often been mistaken for being from England or Ireland when traveling to areas outside of the Outer Banks . The brogue is more distinctive the further south one travels on the Outer Banks , with it being the thickest on Ocracoke Island and Harkers Island . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The Outer Banks is a string of peninsulas and barrier islands separating the Atlantic Ocean from mainland North Carolina . From north to south , the largest of these include : Bodie Island ( which used to be an island but is now a peninsula due to tropical storms and hurricanes ) , Hatteras Island , Ocracoke Island , Portsmouth Island , and the Core Banks . Over time , the exact number of islands and inlets changes as new inlets are opened up , often during a breach created during violent storms , and older inlets close , usually due to gradually sifting sands during the dynamic processes of beach evolution . \n",

      "1) Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : \n",
      "\n",
      "3)Email marketing - Wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Email marketing is the act of sending a commercial message , typically to a group of people , using email . In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . \n",

      "1)The Mother ( How I Met Your Mother ) - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Tracy McConnell , better known as `` The Mother '' , is the title character from the CBS television sitcom How I Met Your Mother . The show , narrated by Future Ted , tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother . Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in `` Something New '' and was promoted to a main character in season 9 . The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Later , in `` Girls Versus Suits '' , Ted dates Cindy , not knowing that her roommate is his future wife . Throughout the episode , Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate . When in Cindy and the mother 's apartment he picks up many of The Mother 's belongings , attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are ( thinking the items are Cindy 's ) and glimpses the mother 's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower . Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band . Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions , `` this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back . '' In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is revealed that , after Ted left the apartment , the Mother had discovered the umbrella and , upon going to question Cindy , finds her in a state . As she tried to console her , Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted , and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive , before spontaneously kissing her , revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush . While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian , it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating , as the kiss was her first in a long time . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Mother , joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death . After the funeral service , she returns to the apartment to open Max 's last gift to her -- a ukulele . The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) In the series finale , it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children , Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness . In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead . Ted says that she `` became sick '' and his children saying that she has been `` gone '' for six years . Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother 's death . Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die , but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning . Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was `` an amazing character '' and that `` over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy . Kuchman said that `` asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request '' , that the finale `` advanced too quickly '' and that `` HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In a flashforward in `` The Lighthouse '' , Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn . She immediately accepts . In another flashfoward in `` Unpause '' , the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child , Luke , in the year 2017 . She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series , including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment . Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky 's wedding ; this scene is shown in `` Last Forever '' , the series finale . The Mother 's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024 , also revealed in the series finale , received a mixed reaction from fans . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The Mother meets all of Ted 's best friends ( Barney , Lily , Marshall and Robin ) before she meets him . The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin , as revealed through a flashback in `` Platonish '' . In `` The Locket '' , Tracy meets Lily on a train journey . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The Mother 's real name is not revealed until the series finale , `` Last Forever '' . When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station , she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell . In the season 1 episode `` Belly Full of Turkey '' , Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says `` ... that , kids , is the true story of how I met your mother '' . The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking , which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother 's name is Tracy . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The Mother is first shown meeting Louis in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now - lead band member Darren talks to his fans . Later at MacLaren 's Pub , she tells him she 's not yet ready to date . Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after . \n",

      "1)Human fertilization - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm , usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell , or fertilized egg , initiating prenatal development . Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Usually 23 chromosomes from spermatozoon and 23 chromosomes from egg cell fuse ( half of spermatozoons carry X chromosome and the other half Y chromosome ) . Their membranes dissolve , leaving no barriers between the male and female chromosomes . During this dissolution , a mitotic spindle forms between them . The spindle captures the chromosomes before they disperse in the egg cytoplasm . Upon subsequently undergoing mitosis ( which includes pulling of chromatids towards centrioles in anaphase ) the cell gathers genetic material from the male and female together . Thus , the first mitosis of the union of sperm and oocyte is the actual fusion of their chromosomes . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The sperm 's tail and mitochondria degenerate with the formation of the male pronucleus . This is why all mitochondria in humans are of maternal origin . Still , a considerable amount of RNA from the sperm is delivered to the resulting embryo and likely influences embryo development and the phenotype of the offspring . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The sperm binds through the corona radiata , a layer of follicle cells on the outside of the secondary oocyte . Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell , known as zygote . The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The oocyte completes its second meiotic division . This results in a mature ovum . The nucleus of the oocyte is called a pronucleus in this process , to distinguish it from the nuclei that are the result of fertilization . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) After the sperm enters the cytoplasm of the oocyte ( also called ovocyte ) , the tail and the outer coating of the sperm disintegrate and the cortical reaction takes place , preventing other sperm from fertilizing the same egg . The oocyte now undergoes its second meiotic division producing the haploid ovum and releasing a polar body . The sperm nucleus then fuses with the ovum , enabling fusion of their genetic material . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Some sperm cells consume their acrosome prematurely on the surface of the egg cell , facilitating the penetration by other sperm cells . As a population , sperm cells have on average 50 % genome similarity so the premature acrosomal reactions aid fertilization by a member of the same cohort . It may be regarded as a mechanism of kin selection . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Once the sperm cells find their way past the zona pellucida , the cortical reaction occurs . Cortical granules inside the secondary oocyte fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell , causing enzymes inside these granules to be expelled by exocytosis to the zona pellucida . This in turn causes the glyco - proteins in the zona pellucida to cross-link with each other -- i.e. the enzymes cause the ZP2 to hydrolyse into ZP2f -- making the whole matrix hard and impermeable to sperm . This prevents fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm . The cortical reaction and acrosome reaction are both essential to ensure that only one sperm will fertilize an egg . \n",

      "1)Roanoke Colony - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) John Lawson wrote in his 1709 work A New Voyage to Carolina that the Croatans living on Hatteras Island used to live on Roanoke Island and claimed to have white ancestors : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Once the Jamestown settlement was established in 1607 , efforts were undertaken by the English to acquire information from the Powhatan tribe about Roanoke . The first definitive information concerning the fate of the Lost Colony came from Captain John Smith , leader of the Jamestown Colony from 1608 to 1609 . According to chronicler Samuel Purchas , Smith learned from Chief Powhatan that he had personally conducted the slaughter of the Roanoke colonists just prior to the arrival of the Jamestown settlers because they were living with the Chesepians , a tribe living in the eastern portion of the present - day South Hampton Roads sub-region who were related to the Pamlico tribe in Carolina and who refused to merge with the Powhatans . This shocking information was reported to England and by the spring of 1609 , King James and the Royal Council were convinced that Chief Powhatan was responsible for the slaughter of the Lost Colony . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The colonists disappeared during the Anglo - Spanish War , three years after the last shipment of supplies from England . Their disappearance gave rise to the nickname `` The Lost Colony '' . There is no conclusive evidence as to what happened to the colonists . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) However , the case was far from settled . A similar legend claims that the now extinct Saponi of Person County , North Carolina , are descended from the English colonists of Roanoke Island . However , no documented evidence exists to link the Saponi to the Roanoke colonists . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Harriot reports that relations between the Roanoke Indians and the English settlers were mutually calm and prosperous , contradicting other historical evidence that catalogs the bloody struggles between the Roanoke Indians and both of Raleigh 's commanders , Sir Richard Grenville and his successor , Ralph Lane . Harriot recounts little to none of these accounts in his report to England and does not mention the disorderly state of the colony under either Grenville 's or Lane 's tenure , correctly assuming these facts would prevent Roanoke from gaining more settlers . Harriot 's text did not reach England , or the English press , until 1588 , by which time the fate of the `` Lost Colony '' was sealed in all but name . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The Roanoke Colony ( / ˈroʊəˌnoʊk / ) , also known as the Lost Colony , was established in 1585 on Roanoke Island in what is today 's Dare County , North Carolina . It was a late 16th - century attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent English settlement in North America . The colony was founded by Sir Walter Raleigh . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In 1587 , Raleigh dispatched a new group of 115 colonists to establish a colony on Chesapeake Bay . They were led by John White , an artist and friend of Raleigh who had accompanied the previous expedition to Roanoke , and was appointed governor of the 1587 colony . White and Raleigh named 12 assistants to aid in the settlement . They were ordered to stop at Roanoke to pick up the small contingent left there by Grenville the previous year , but when they arrived on July 22 , 1587 , they found nothing except a skeleton that may have been the remains of one of the English garrison . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Between their arrival in Roanoke in April 1585 and the July 1586 departure , Harriot and White both conducted detailed studies of the Roanoke area , with Harriot compiling his samples and notes into several notebooks that did not survive the colony 's disappearance . Harriot also wrote descriptions of the surrounding flora and fauna of the area , which survive in his work A Brief and True Report of the New Founde Land of Virginia , written as a report on the colony 's progress to the English government on the request of Raleigh . Viewed by modern historians as propaganda for the colony , this work has become vastly important to Roanoke 's history due to Harriot 's observations on wildlife as well as his depictions of Indian activities at the time of the colony 's disappearance . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The researchers concluded that the settlers of the Lost Colony landed at Roanoke Island in the summer of the worst growing - season drought in 800 years . `` This drought persisted for 3 years , from 1587 to 1589 , and is the driest 3 - year episode in the entire 800 - year reconstruction , '' the team reported in the journal Science . A map shows that `` the Lost Colony drought affected the entire southeastern United States but was particularly severe in the Tidewater region near Roanoke ( Island ) . '' The authors suggested that the Croatan who were shot and killed by the colonists may have been scavenging the abandoned village for food as a result of the drought . \n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Pom Klementieff ( born 3 May 1986 ) is a French actress . She was trained at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris and has appeared in such films as Loup ( 2009 ) , Sleepless Night ( 2011 ) and Hacker 's Game ( 2015 ) . She plays the role of Mantis in the film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ( 2017 ) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers : Infinity War ( 2018 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Klementieff moved to Los Angeles after Oldboy was filmed and began pursuing more Hollywood auditions . She continued taekwondo after the film , and has a purple belt as of the summer of 2014 . Her next acting role was the film Hacker 's Game ( 2015 ) , in which she plays a hacker she compared to Lisbeth Salander from the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo . Klementieff used her boxing skills again in the film , and due to the movie 's low budget , she had to do her own make - up and chose her own wardrobe . It was her idea to dye her hair purple for the role , to which the directors first objected but later acquiesced . She joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe with her role as Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ( 2017 ) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers : Infinity War ( 2018 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Klementieff made her Hollywood debut in Spike Lee 's Oldboy ( 2013 ) , a remake of the South Korean film of the same name . She portrayed Haeng - Bok , the bodyguard of the antagonist played by Sharlto Copley . A fan of the original film , Klementieff heard about the part through Roy Lee , a producer with the remake , and took boxing lessons after learning the role involved martial arts . After showcasing her boxing skills during her audition , Lee asked her to go home and come back wearing a more feminine outfit and make - up , like her character in the film . She contributed some of her own clothes to the character 's wardrobe , and trained three hours a day for two months for an on - screen fight with star Josh Brolin . Klementieff came up with the name Haeng - Bok , Korean for `` happiness '' , herself after Lee asked her to research possible names for the character . \n",
      "\n",
      "4)Pom Klementieff - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Klementieff 's first professional acting job was the French independent film Après lui ( 2007 ) , portraying the stepdaughter of the protagonist played by Catherine Deneuve . Filming for her scenes took three days . During one scene , Klementieff was supposed to push someone down a set of stairs but accidentally fell down the stairs herself , and director Gaël Morel kept that shot in the final film . Her first leading role was in Loup ( 2009 ) , a French film about a tribe of reindeer herders in the Siberian mountains . During filming , Klementieff stayed in a camp , hours from the nearest village , where temperatures dropped well below zero . During filming she befriended nomads who lived there , worked with real wolves , rode reindeer , and swam with a horse in a lake . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Pom Klementieff was born in Quebec City , Quebec , Canada , to a Korean mother and French - Russian father , who was working there as a consul with the French government . She had a brother who committed suicide . Her parents chose the name `` Pom '' because it is similar in pronunciation to the Korean words for both `` spring '' ( 봄 ) and `` tiger '' ( 범 ) . Klementieff lived in Canada for one year before her family traveled extensively due to her father 's job , and she lived in Japan and the Ivory Coast before settling in France . Klementieff later said that travelling at an early age gave her a `` gypsy soul '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Klementieff 's father died of cancer when she was 5 , and her mother was schizophrenic and unable to care for children , so Klementieff was raised by her paternal uncle and aunt . Her uncle , whom she described as `` like my second father '' , died on her 18th birthday . Klementieff briefly attended law school after her uncle 's death to appease her aunt , but did not find the career path appealing . She also worked as a waitress and saleswoman in France . She started acting at age 19 at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris . A few months into her education , she won a theater competition that awarded her free classes for two years with the school 's top teachers . \n",

Among them is a redeemed Professor Hinkle , who is proudly wearing his new top hat . At the end of the parade , Frosty gets back into Santa 's waiting sleigh and they return to the North Pole , with Frosty proclaiming , `` I 'll be back on Christmas Day ! '' \n",

      "4) Hocus brings Santa Claus to the greenhouse only to find Karen in tears and Frosty melted on the floor due to Hinkle 's cruel act . Santa explains to Karen that Frosty is made from Christmas snow , and that he can never completely disappear , only take the form of summer rain , until next December . With a gust of cold wind through the open greenhouse door , the puddle that was Frosty blows out the door and magically changes back into his typical snowman form . Before Santa can put the finishing touch on Frosty and bring him back to life , as Hocus arrives with the hat , Hinkle arrives on the scene and again demands the return of his hat . He relents only when threatened with being removed from Santa 's Christmas list for the rest of his life if he put so much as one finger on the hat . Santa states that if Hinkle is truly repentant for his mean attitude and harming Frosty , and if he goes home and writes `` I am really sorry for what I did to Frosty '' a hundred zillion times , he may find a gift in his stocking on Christmas morning , which makes Hinkle bid Frosty and Karen farewell and run home to repeatedly write his apologies , assuming he may get a new hat . Finally , Santa then places the magic hat back on top of Frosty 's head , and the snowman returns to life again . After celebrating , Santa takes Karen home and Frosty to the North Pole , but promises that Frosty will be back next winter . \n",

      "5) One December afternoon , a little girl named Karen and her friends create a snowman after a class Christmas party at school . After several suggestions of what to call their snowman ( including `` Oatmeal '' and `` Christopher Columbus '' ) , Karen decides to name him `` Frosty . '' Later , the children acquire a top hat discarded by inept magician Professor Hinkle . Karen places the hat on top of Frosty 's head , and the snowman comes to life ( and always says `` Happy Birthday ! '' in response ) . When Hinkle learns of the magic power his hat actually possesses , he takes it back and departs , pretending that he did not see Frosty come to life . However , the professor 's pet rabbit , Hocus Pocus , returns the hat to Frosty and the children . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Frosty the Snowman is a 1969 animated Christmas television special based on the song `` Frosty the Snowman '' . The program , which first aired on December 7 , 1969 on CBS ( where it continues to air annually ) , was produced for television by Rankin / Bass Productions and featured the voices of comedians Jimmy Durante as the film 's narrator ( Durante 's final performance in a film ) and Jackie Vernon as the title character . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Family Home Entertainment released Frosty the Snowman on VHS as part of the Christmas Classics Series in 1989 and 1993 , with multiple re-prints throughout the 1990s . It was paired with The Little Drummer Boy on LaserDisc in 1992 . Upon its 1989 and 1993 releases , the special was also bundled in box sets with the other Rankin / Bass Christmas specials including Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer and Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town , the 1973 Chuck Jones holiday special , A Very Merry Cricket and the sequel Frosty Returns which aired on CBS in 1992 . In 1998 , Sony Wonder and Golden Books Family Entertainment released the special on VHS , and also paired it with these other Rankin / Bass Christmas specials including Cricket on the Hearth in the separate Holiday Classics Collection box sets . \n",

      "8) Frosty soon senses the temperature is rising and worries about melting away . The children suggest putting him on the next train to the North Pole , where he will never melt , and they all parade into the city on the way to the train station , where Frosty has his confrontation with the traffic cop mentioned in the song 's lyrics . When Karen explains that Frosty came to life and does n't know what a traffic light or a lamp post is , the traffic cop lets Frosty go . At the train station , Frosty stows away aboard a refrigerated train car , since neither he nor the children have any money for a train ticket . As the train is about to leave the station , Karen and Hocus decide to join Frosty for the ride to keep him company . With that , Frosty , Karen , and Hocus wave goodbye to the other kids as the train takes off . Unbeknownst to them , Hinkle has also hitched a ride on the train , intending to get his hat back . \n",

      "9) Released by Rhino on October 1 , 2002 , the entire audio portion of Frosty the Snowman is available on CD along with the entire audio portion of Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town , the Rankin / Bass special produced in 1970 . This edition contains the full dialogue and song audio of both specials . \n",

      "10) As the train continues up north , however , Frosty notices Karen is freezing and starting to catch a cold , so they jump off the train , leaving Hinkle behind once again . Hinkle , seeing them escape , jumps off the train too , but falls down a mountain and crashes into a tree where a pile of snow falls on him . At Frosty 's request , Hocus convinces some forest animals who are preparing for Christmas to build a campfire for Karen . Fearing that Karen still can not survive for long in the cold weather , Frosty asks Hocus who might be able to help them . Hocus suggests ( by pantomiming ) the President of the United States and the United States Marines , before suggesting Santa Claus . Frosty agrees , and promptly takes credit for the idea himself ( much to Hocus ' annoyance ) . Hocus hops off to get Santa , but Hinkle then confronts Frosty and Karen once more and blows out Karen 's campfire . Frosty and Karen are again forced to flee , this time with Karen riding on Frosty 's back as he slides head - first down a hill . At the bottom of the slope , Karen and Frosty discover a greenhouse filled with Christmas poinsettias . Despite Karen 's objections , Frosty steps inside the warm greenhouse with her , suggesting that he could afford to lose a little weight while she warms up . Unfortunately , an angry and vengeful Hinkle catches up to them immediately after and locks them in the greenhouse . \n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) The survival of the Acadian settlements was based on successful cooperation with the Indigenous peoples of the region . In the early years of Acadian settlement , this included a small number of recorded marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women . Some records have survived showing marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women in formal Roman Catholic rites , for example , the marriage of Charles La Tour to a Mi'kmaw woman in 1626 . There were also reported instances of Acadian settlers marrying Indigenous spouses according to Mi'kmaq rites , and subsequently living in Mi'kmaq communities . Many settlers also brought French wives with them to Acadia , such as La Tour 's second wife , Françoise - Marie Jacquelin , who joined him in Acadia in 1640 . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) There was already a long history of Acadian and Wabanaki Confederacy resistance to the British occupation of Acadia during the four French and Indian Wars and two local wars ( Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) before the Expulsion of the Acadians . The Mi'kmaq and the Acadians were allies through Catholicism and through numerous inter-marriages . The Mi'kmaq held the military strength in Acadia even after the conquest of 1710 . They primarily resisted the British occupation of Acadia and were joined in their efforts on numerous occasions by Acadians . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The history of the Acadians was significantly influenced by the six colonial wars that took place in Acadia during the 17th and 18th century ( see the four French and Indian Wars , Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) . Eventually , the last of the colonial wars -- the French and Indian War -- resulted in the British Expulsion of the Acadians from the region . After the war , many Acadians came out of hiding or returned to Acadia from the British Colonies . Others remained in France and some migrated from there to Louisiana , where they became known as Cajuns , a corruption of the word Acadiens or Acadians . The nineteenth century saw the beginning of the Acadian Renaissance and the publication of Evangeline , which helped galvanize Acadian identity . In the last century Acadians have made achievements in the areas of equal language and cultural rights as a minority group in the Maritime provinces of Canada . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) While many Acadians traded with the New England Protestants , Acadians ' participation in the wars clearly indicated that many were reluctant to be ruled by the British . During the first colonial war , King William 's War ( 1688 -- 97 ) , the crews of the very successful French privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste were primarily Acadian . The Acadians resisted during the Raid on Chignecto ( 1696 ) . During Queen Anne 's War , Mi'kmaq and Acadians resisted during the Raid on Grand Pré , Piziquid and Chignecto in 1704 . The Acadians also assisted the French in protecting the capital in the Siege of Port Royal ( 1707 ) and the final Conquest of Acadia . The Acadians and Mi'kmaq were also successful in the Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1711 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) After the end of the Seven Years ' War in 1763 , Acadians were allowed to return to Nova Scotia as long as they did not settle in any one area in large numbers ; they were not permitted to resettle in the areas of Port Royal or Grand - Pré . Some Acadians resettled along the Nova Scotia coast and remain scattered across Nova Scotia to this day . Many dispersed Acadians looked for other homes . Beginning in 1764 , groups of Acadians began to arrive in Louisiana ( which had passed to Spanish control in 1762 ) . They eventually became known as Cajuns . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Some Acadians escaped into the woods and lived with the Mi'kmaq ; some bands of partisans fought the British , including a group led by Joseph Broussard , known as `` Beausoleil '' , along the Petitcodiac River of New Brunswick . Some followed the coast northward , facing famine and disease . Some were recaptured , facing deportation or imprisonment at Fort Beausejour ( renamed Fort Cumberland ) until 1763 . \n",

      "9) Kennedy ( 2014 ) argues that the emigrants from the Vienne region of France carried to Acadia their customs and social structure . They were frontier people , who dispersed their settlements based on kinship . They optimized use of farmland and emphasized trading for a profit . They were hierarchical and politically active . The French and the Acadian villages were similar in terms of prosperity , egalitarianism , and independent - mindedness . Kennedy says the emergence of a distinct Acadian identity emerged from the gradual adaptation of traditional French methods , institutions , and ideas to the North American environmental and political situations . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Beginning in the 1770s , many Acadians were encouraged to return through the policies of Nova Scotia Governor Michael Francklin , who guaranteed Catholic worship , land grants and issued a promise that there would be no second expulsion ( At this time , Nova Scotia included present - day New Brunswick ) . However the fertile Acadian dykelands had been resettled by New England Planters , who were soon followed by Loyalists who further occupied former Acadian lands . Returning Acadians and those families who had escaped expulsion had to settle in other parts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick , in most cases isolated and infertile lands . The new Acadian settlements were forced to focus more on fishery and later forestry . \n",

      "\n",
      "2)Outer Banks - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The northern part of the Outer Banks , from Oregon Inlet northward , is actually a part of the North American mainland , since the northern inlets of Bodie Island and Currituck Banks no longer exist . It is separated by the Currituck Sound and the Intracoastal Waterway , which passes through the Great Dismal Swamp occupying much of the mainland west of the Outer Banks . Road access to the northern Outer Banks is cut off between Sandbridge and Corolla , North Carolina , with communities such as Carova Beach accessible only by four - wheel drive vehicles . North Carolina State Highway 12 links most of the popular Outer Banks communities in this section of the coast . The easternmost point is Cape Point at Cape Hatteras on Hatteras Island , site of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Outer Banks ( OBX ) is a 200 - mile - long ( 320 km ) string of barrier islands and spits off the coast of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia , on the east coast of the United States . They cover most of the North Carolina coastline , separating the Currituck Sound , Albemarle Sound , and Pamlico Sound from the Atlantic Ocean . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The abbreviations OBX ( Outer Banks ) and SOBX ( Southern Outer Banks ) are modern terms used to promote tourism and to market a variety of stickers , t - shirts , and other items to vacationers . OBX , which originated first , is generally used in the northern Outer Banks . SOBX is used primarily in Carteret County , which is also known as the Crystal Coast . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Outer Banks stretch southward from Sandbridge in Virginia Beach down the North Carolina coastline . Sources differ regarding the southern terminus of the Outer Banks . Generations of North Carolina schoolchildren have learned that the term includes the state 's three prominent capes : Cape Hatteras , Cape Lookout , and Cape Fear . Other sources limit the definition to two capes ( Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout ) and coastal areas in four counties ( Currituck County , Dare County , Hyde County , and Carteret County ) . Some authors include Carteret 's Shackelford Banks and Bogue Banks in their descriptions , while others exclude Bogue Banks . Still other references restrict the definition to the northern three counties of Currituck , Dare , and Hyde . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The vegetation of the Outer Banks varies . In the northeast part of the Outer Banks , from Virginia Beach southward past the North Carolina border to Oregon Inlet , the main types of vegetation are sea grasses , beach grasses and other beach plants including Opuntia humifusa on the Atlantic side and wax myrtles , bays , and grasses on the Sound side with areas of pine and Spanish moss - covered live oaks . Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa can be found growing wild here in the northern parts of its range on the beach . Sabal Minor palms were once indigenous to the entire Outer Banks , and they are still successfully planted and grown . Its current most northerly known native stand is on Monkey Island in Currituck County . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) From Cape Hatteras National Seashore southward , the vegetation does include that of the northeastern Outer Banks such as Sabal minor , Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa ; however , the main vegetation consists of Cabbage palmetto ( Sabal palmetto ) , which can be found in the north , although they are native in the southern part of the Outer Banks , specifically prevalent from Cape Hatteras and all points southward . Pindo palms and windmill palms are also planted widely throughout the Outer Banks ; although , they are not indigenous to the area . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Before bridges were built in the 1930s , the only form of transport between or off the islands was by boat , which allowed for the islands to stay isolated from much of the rest of the mainland . This helped to preserve the maritime culture and the distinctive Outer Banks accent or brogue , which sounds more like an English accent than it does an American accent . Many `` bankers '' have often been mistaken for being from England or Ireland when traveling to areas outside of the Outer Banks . The brogue is more distinctive the further south one travels on the Outer Banks , with it being the thickest on Ocracoke Island and Harkers Island . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The Outer Banks is a string of peninsulas and barrier islands separating the Atlantic Ocean from mainland North Carolina . From north to south , the largest of these include : Bodie Island ( which used to be an island but is now a peninsula due to tropical storms and hurricanes ) , Hatteras Island , Ocracoke Island , Portsmouth Island , and the Core Banks . Over time , the exact number of islands and inlets changes as new inlets are opened up , often during a breach created during violent storms , and older inlets close , usually due to gradually sifting sands during the dynamic processes of beach evolution . \n",

      "3) Within the Manila complex of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is the Museo ng Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ( English : Museum of the Central Bank of the Philippines ) . Inaugurated on January 3 , 1999 , as part of the celebration of the 50 years of central banking in the Philippines , the museum showcases the Bank 's collection of currencies . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ( lit . Central Bank of the Philippines ; commonly abbreviated as BSP in both Filipino and English ) is the central bank of the Philippines . It was established on 3 July 1993 , pursuant to the provision of Republic Act 7653 or the New Central Bank Act of 1993 . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) By 1933 , a group of Filipinos had conceptualised a central bank for the Philippine Islands . It came up with the rudiments of a bill for the establishment of a central bank after a careful study of the economic provisions of the Hare -- Hawes -- Cutting Act , which would grant Philippine independence after 12 years , but reserving military and naval bases for the United States and imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports . However , the Hare -- Hawes -- Cutting Act would be rejected by the Senate of the Philippines at the urging of Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon . This Senate then advocated a new bill that won United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's support , this would be the Tydings -- McDuffie Act , which would grant Philippine independence on July 4 , 1946 . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Bangko Sentral has 19 currencies directly convertible with the Philippine piso , which serves as a benchmark for all Philippine banks . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Shortly after President Manuel Roxas assumed office in 1946 , he instructed then - Finance Secretary Miguel Cuaderno , Sr. to draw up a charter for a central bank . The establishment of a monetary authority became imperative a year later as a result of the findings of the Joint Philippine - American Finance Commission chaired by Cuaderno . The Commission , which studied Philippine financial , monetary , and fiscal problems in 1947 , recommended a shift from the dollar exchange standard to a managed currency system . A central bank was necessary to implement the proposed shift to the new system . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The current members of the Monetary Board are : \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In accordance with a provision in the 1987 Constitution , President Fidel V. Ramos signed Republic Act No. 7653 , otherwise known as the New Central Bank Act , into law on June 14 , 1993 . The law provides for the establishment of an independent monetary authority to be known as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas , its primary objective being the maintenance of price stability . This objective was only implied in the old Central Bank charter . The law also gives the Bangko Sentral fiscal and administrative autonomy which the old Central Bank did not have . On July 3 , 1993 , the New Central Bank Act took effect . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Under the Commonwealth , discussions continued regarding the idea of a Philippine central bank that would promote price stability and economic growth . The country 's monetary system then was administered by the Department of Finance and the National Treasury , and the Philippine piso was on the exchange standard using the United States dollar , which was backed by 100 percent gold reserve , as the standard currency . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Takt time can be first determined with the formula : \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Takt time is the average time between the start of production of one unit and the start of production of the next unit , when these production starts are set to match the rate of customer demand . For example , if a customer wants 10 units per week , then , given a 40 - hour work week and steady flow through the production line , the average time between production starts should be 4 hours , yielding 10 units produced per week . Note , a common misconception is that takt time is related to the time it takes to actually make the product . In the previous example , whether it takes 4 minutes or 4 years to produce the product , the takt time should be 4 hours ( of course , the time it takes to produce the product will impact the magnitude of the number of units actually in production at any point in time ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Assuming a product is made one unit at a time at a constant rate during the net available work time , the takt time is the amount of time that must elapse between two consecutive unit completions in order to meet the demand . \n",
      "\n",
      "4)Takt time - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Where T = Takt time , e.g. ( work time between two consecutive units ) T = Net time available to work , e.g. ( work time per period ) D = Demand ( customer demand ) , e.g. ( units required per period ) \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Some of the early literature uses cycle time for takt time . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Once a takt system is implemented there are a number of benefits : \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Downsides of takt time organization include : \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Also , takt time may be adjusted according to requirements within the company . For example , if one department delivers parts to several manufacturing lines , it often makes sense to use similar takt times on all lines to smooth out flow from the preceding station . Customer demand can still be met by adjusting daily working time , reducing down times on machines and so on . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Example : If there are a total of 8 hours ( or 480 minutes ) in a shift ( gross time ) less 30 minutes lunch , 30 minutes for breaks ( 2 × 15 mins ) , 10 minutes for a team briefing and 10 minutes for basic maintenance checks , then the net Available Time to Work = 480 - 30 - 30 - 10 - 10 = 400 minutes . \n",

      "\n",
      "2) The book is a first - person narrative told by a young narrator who experiences troubles in his life ( mostly aggressive small animals that bite and sting ) and wishes to escape them . He sets out for the city of Solla Sollew ( `` where they never have troubles / at least very few '' ) and learns that he must face his problems instead of running away from them . He then goes back home to deal with his `` troubles '' , arming himself with a big bat and resolving that `` Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me ! '' \n",
      "\n",
      "3) At first , the protagonist considers joining the doorman , but realizing that he 's come all this way for nothing , the protagonist , instead , decides to go back home to the Valley of Vung and face his troubles . He now knows he will have troubles for the rest of his life , but he 's ready for them . Armed with a bat , the Protagonist now gives the rocks , quail , skritz , and skrink troubles of their own ( `` But I 've bought a big bat . I 'm all ready , you see . Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me ! '' ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew is a 1965 children 's book by Dr. Seuss . The story features classic Seuss rhymes and drawings in his distinctive pen and ink style . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) As the protagonist tries to fight off his troubles , a man on a One Wheel Wubble drawn by a camel comes up and explains that like the protagonist , he too is experiencing a troubled life and has decided to escape his troubles by going to Solla Sollew , a city on the beautiful banks of the river Wah - Hoo , and known to never have troubles ( at least very few ) . He invites the protagonist to come along with him . Eager to escape his troubles , the protagonist joins the wubble driver , but after a long night of traveling , the camel gets sick and starts to bubble . At first , the driver and protagonist pull him on the wubble , but for the rest of the day , the driver acts lazy and has the protagonist do all the hard work . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The journey includes several fantastic , and troublesome , encounters . In one instance , the protagonist is forced to haul a wagon for a bossy companion . ( `` ' This is called teamwork . I furnish the brains . You furnish the muscles , the aches and the pains . ' '' ) In another scene , he is drafted into the army under the command of the fearsome ( and , ultimately , cowardly ) General Genghis Kahn Schmitz , who abandons him at a critical moment . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) At the gates of Solla Sollew , the protagonist is greeted by a friendly doorman . The doorman explains to the protagonist about the only trouble the city has : a key - slapping slippard has moved into the lock of the door , which happens to be the only way into Solla Sollew , and bugs the doorman by continuously slapping the key out of his hand , preventing anyone from entering the city . As it 's considered bad luck to kill a slippard , the doorman can not do anything to evict this pest , but decides instead to leave Solla Sollew for the city of Boola Boo Ball , on the banks of the beautiful river Woo - Wall , and known to never have troubles ( `` No troubles at all ! ! '' ) and invites the protagonist to come along . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The next day they thankfully discover a camel doctor , Dr. Sam Snell , who diagnoses their camel with a bad case of gleeks and orders him to bed for twenty weeks . The driver makes it up to the protagonist by telling him he can catch the 4 : 42 bus to Solla Sollew at the nearest bus stop , but when the protagonist gets to the bus stop he learns from a sign tacked on a stick that the Solla Sollew bound bus is out of service ( the driver , Butch Myers , apparently destroyed all his tires from accidentally running over four nails ) , leaving him to hike for one hundred miles . Soon , the poor protagonist is caught in a storm . A kindly stranger tells him that the storm is the infamous `` Midwinter Jicker '' and allows the protagonist to take shelter in his house , where a family of mice and a family of owls are also taking shelter . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The protagonist manages to escape the Poozers by diving down an air vent marked `` Vent No. 5 '' but has to spend the next three days trying to find his way through a network of tunnels inhabited by birds , all going in the wrong direction . Close to the end of the third day , he finally finds a door and discovers he 's come out at the beautiful banks of the river Wah - Hoo . Realizing he 's reached his goal , the protagonist rushes out to Solla Sollew . \n",

He spends twelve days in the flood - waters , until somebody rescues him by throwing down a rope . The protagonist climbs the rope , only to discover that his savior is General Genghis Kahn Schmitz , who immediately drafts him into his army for an upcoming battle against the Perilous Poozer of Pompelmoose Pass , a lion - like creature . At the pass , the General discovers he and his army are outnumbered by too many Poozers and orders an immediate retreat without fighting , leaving the protagonist to face the Poozers alone , armed only with `` a shooter and one little bean '' . \n",

      "1) `` Shape of You '' is a song by English singer - songwriter Ed Sheeran . It was released as a digital download on 6 January 2017 as one of the double lead singles from his third studio album ÷ ( 2017 ) , along with `` Castle on the Hill '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The dancehall - infused pop song was written by Ed Sheeran together with Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid , with additional writing credits given to Kandi Burruss , Tameka `` Tiny '' Cottle , and Kevin `` She'kspere '' Briggs as Sheeran had incorporated an interpolation of the TLC 's song `` No Scrubs '' into `` Shape of You '' . The song was produced by Sheeran and Mac . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) According to Sheeran , Steve Mac started the song - writing session by playing the opening notes of the song on the keyboard . Sheeran then joined in , adding percussion by tapping on the guitar , layering it onto the track . On the writing of the song , he said that he tried to keep the music `` more stripped '' instead of something more elaborate : `` I 'm an acoustic artist , first and foremost . And when I play live , I ca n't replicate these things , I have n't got all the other musicians . '' Sheeran said he wanted an R&B feel to the song , therefore he adjusted the original tune , adding an interpolation of `` No Scrubs '' onto part of the melody . He also revealed that the original lyrics did not end with the words `` the shape of you '' in the chorus , but during the writing of the song , McDaid thought that the lyrics `` I 'm in love with your body '' sounded objectifying , and the lyrics was therefore adjusted . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The song was the last song written for Sheeran 's third album ÷ . On 6 January 2017 , when hosting The Radio 1 Breakfast Show , Sheeran revealed that `` Shape of You '' had originally been written with Rihanna in mind . As he had already written all the songs he wanted for the album , the song was therefore not intended to be included in the album . It was conceived as a duet between Rihanna and Rudimental , but the head of the record label convinced him to keep the song for himself . He said : \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Jon Caramanica from The New York Times said , `` ' Shape of You ' is trickier , a nimble and effective song that takes the aggressive thinning of ' Caribbean music ' . '' Billboard 's Taylor Weatherby wrote about the song saying , `` ' Shape of You ' does n't quite sound like your typical Sheeran tune . But that almost serves as an indication of what the `` Thinking Out Loud '' singer has been up to during his hiatus : creating music that still feels like Sheeran , just with a new twist . '' Jeremy Gordon of Spin gave the song a positive review , stating that the song `` is a plausible attempt at convincing us he has had sex ... a lot of it . It kind of slaps , though you ca n't really picture Sheeran ever saying ' put that body on me ' to a real human woman . '' News website Metro wrote that it sounds similar to the song `` Cheap Thrills '' by Sia . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) `` Shape of You '' is a pop , dancehall and tropical house song with `` strummy acoustics . '' In the song , Sheeran sings over a marimba - fueled percussive sway about a budding romance . `` The club is n't the best place to find a lover , so the bar is where I go / Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow '' , he sings . `` Come over and start up a conversation with just me / And trust me I 'll give it a chance . '' According to NT News , the song `` tells the story of loved ( or lusted ) up Sheeran meeting a girl in a bar where he and his mates are doing shots . '' `` Shape of You '' is written in the key of C ♯ minor with a tempo of 96 beats per minute . The song is composed in common time ( time ) , and follows a basic chord progression of C ♯ m -- F ♯ m -- A -- B ( i -- iv -- VI -- VII ) , and Sheeran 's vocals span from G ♯ to G ♯ . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) `` ( ' Shape of You ' ) is actually a really random one because I went in to write songs for other people with a guy called Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid , and we were writing this song and I was like ' this would really work for Rihanna , ' '' he explained . `` And then I started singing lyrics like ' putting Van The Man on the jukebox ' and I was like ' well she 's not really going to sing that , is she ? ' And then we sort of decided halfway through that we were just going to make it for me . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "8) On 4 January 2017 , Sheeran uploaded a six - second teaser video of a blue background to social media , with lyrics `` the club is n't the best place to find a lover '' , which is the first line of `` Shape of You '' . To further tease the release , Sheeran and his label used a sponsored Snapchat lens filter with 30 seconds on the song to increase buzz among the general public . \n",

      "\n",
      "10) In the United States , `` Shape of You '' has immediately become a favorite among DJs and remixers , prompting several of them to create their own versions . One DJ , Joe `` Maz '' Masurka , told Billboard that after he did his own remix on the single that he received a lot of great feedback and response : `` I absolutely love the track , so I had to remix it myself so that I could play it in all my live shows . Ed is a genius ; best song in the last few years . I 've been playing it literally everywhere I 've been booked since about mid-January : Hyde Bellagio in Las Vegas , E11even and Ora in Miami , Parq in San Diego , Premier Atlantic City ... the dance floor loves it . '' A Latin remix featuring reggaeton duo Zion & Lennox was released on 17 March 2017 . Sheeran and American rapper Lil Uzi Vert performed a live remix of `` Shape Of You '' during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards , followed by a rendition of Lil Uzi Vert 's song `` XO Tour Llif3 '' . \n",

      "1) Classic examples of Nashville sound recordings : \n",
      "\n",
      "2)Nashville sound - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The term `` Nashville Sound '' was first mentioned in an article about Jim Reeves in 1958 in the Music Reporter and again in 1960 in a Time magazine article about Reeves . Other observers have identified several recordings that helped establish the early Nashville sound . Country historian Rich Kienzle says that `` Gone '' , a Ferlin Husky hit recorded in November 1956 , `` may well have pointed the way to the Nashville sound . '' Writer Colin Escott proclaims Jim Reeves ' `` Four Walls '' , recorded February 1957 , to be the `` first ' Nashville sound ' record '' , and Chet Atkins , the RCA - based producer and guitarist most often credited with being the sound 's primary artistic brainchild , pointed to his production of Don Gibson 's `` Oh Lonesome Me '' late that same year . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) In the early 1960s , the Nashville sound began to be challenged by the rival Bakersfield sound on the country side and by the British Invasion on the pop side ; compounding these problems were the sudden deaths , in separate airplane crashes , of Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves , two of the Nashville Sound 's biggest stars . Nashville 's pop song structure became more pronounced and it morphed into what was called Countrypolitan - a smoother sound typified through the use of lush string arrangements with a real orchestra and often , background vocals provided by a choir . Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s . Among the architects of this sound were producers Billy Sherrill ( who was instrumental in shaping Tammy Wynette 's early career ) and Glenn Sutton . Artists who typified the countrypolitan sound initially included Wynette , Glen Campbell ( who recorded in Hollywood and not Nashville ) , Lynn Anderson , Charlie Rich , and Charley Pride , the latter being a rare example of a top - selling African - American country performer . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music , replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with `` smooth strings and choruses '' , `` sophisticated background vocals '' and `` smooth tempos '' . It was an attempt `` to revive country sales , which had been devastated by the rise of rock ' n ' roll . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Bakersfield sound , and later outlaw country , dominated country music among aficionados while countrypolitan reigned on the pop charts . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) By the late 1970s and 1980s , many pop music singers picked up the countrypolitan style and created what is known as country pop , the fusion of country music and soft rock . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The Nashville sound was pioneered by staff at Decca Records , RCA Records and Columbia Records in Nashville , Tennessee , including manager Steve Sholes , record producers Chet Atkins , Owen Bradley , and Bob Ferguson , and recording engineer Bill Porter . They invented the form by replacing elements of the popular honky tonk style ( fiddles , steel guitar , nasal lead vocals ) with `` smooth '' elements from 1950s pop music ( string sections , background vocals , crooning lead vocals ) , and using `` slick '' production , and pop music structures . The producers relied on a small group of studio musicians known as the Nashville A-Team , whose quick adaptability and creative input made them vital to the hit - making process . The Anita Kerr Quartet was the main vocal backing group in the early 1960s . In 1960 , Time magazine reported that Nashville had `` nosed out Hollywood as the nation 's second biggest ( after New York ) record - producing center . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In an essay published in Heartaches by the Number : Country Music 's 500 Greatest Singles , David Cantwell argues that Elvis Presley 's rock and roll recording of `` Do n't Be Cruel '' in July 1956 was the record that sparked the beginning of the era now called the Nashville sound . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Upon being asked what the Nashville sound was , Chet Atkins would put his hand into his pocket , shake his loose change , and say `` That 's what it is . It 's the sound of money '' . \n",

      "1)The New Atlantis ( journal ) - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The journal 's name is taken from Francis Bacon 's utopian novella New Atlantis , which the journal 's editors describe as a `` fable of a society living with the benefits and challenges of advanced science and technology . '' An editorial in the inaugural issue states that the aim of the journal is `` to help us avoid the extremes of euphoria and despair that new technologies too often arouse ; and to help us judge when mobilizing our technological prowess is sensible or necessary , and when the preservation of things that count requires limiting the kinds of technological power that would lessen , cheapen , or ultimately destroy us . '' Writing for National Review , editor Adam Keiper described The New Atlantis as being written from a `` particularly American and conservative way of thinking about both the blessings and the burdens of modern science and technology . '' New Atlantis authors and bioethicists publishing in other journals have also similarly referred to The New Atlantis as being written from a social conservative stance which utilizes religion . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The New Atlantis also publishes a book series , New Atlantis Books , an imprint of Encounter Books . To date , six books have been released : \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Writing for the National Review in a 2003 column , the conservative author Stanley Kurtz described The New Atlantis as influential on thinking about science and technology . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Richard John Neuhaus , late editor of the conservative journal First Things , wrote that The New Atlantis is `` as good a publication as there is for the intelligent exploration of questions in bioethics and projections -- promising , ominous , and fantastical -- about the human future , '' and a writer in The American Conservative described the journal as a source `` of fresh ideas on the Right . '' National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg described The New Atlantis as `` a new and interesting magazine '' that `` seems to be trying to carve out the space for the government to stop the more offensive aspects of biotechnology . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The journal has also published widely on the interpersonal effects of the Internet and digital technology . It has featured articles on subjects like Facebook , cell phones , multitasking , e-readers , GPS and navigation , and virtual reality . A 2006 article by Matthew B. Crawford advocating the intellectual and economic virtues of the manual trades was noted as a best - of - the - year essay by New York Times columnist David Brooks , and was subsequently expanded into the bestselling book Shop Class as Soulcraft . The journal also frequently publishes essays on philosophical and literary questions relating to science and technology . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The New Atlantis tends to publish views in favor of technological innovation but wary of certain avenues of development . For example , the journal has generally advocated nuclear energy ; space exploration and development through public - private partnerships , including manned missions to Mars ; biofuels ; and genetically modified foods . But it has expressed ambivalent or critical views about developments in synthetic biology and military technologies like drones , chemical weapons , and cyberwarfare . Articles often explore policy questions on these and other issues , sometimes advocating particular policy outcomes , especially on health care , environmental management , and energy . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The journal also features broader philosophical reflections on science and technology , and tends to be skeptical of what its authors consider to be speculative overreach common in popular discussions . Examples include articles that have defended the existence of free will in light of developments in neuroscience , questioned the wisdom of using brain scans in courtrooms , and described how growing knowledge of epigenetics has undermined common claims about genetic determinism . While the journal has sometimes aired libertarian views about human enhancement and transhumanism , its contributors generally tend to question whether technologies like artificial intelligence , `` friendly '' artificial intelligence , and genetic enhancement are possible or desirable . The journal also publishes the Futurisms blog , dedicated to criticizing transhumanism . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The New Atlantis , founded in 2003 , is a quarterly journal about the social , ethical , political , and policy dimensions of modern science and technology . The journal is published in Washington , D.C. by the social conservative advocacy group the Ethics and Public Policy Center in partnership with the Center for the Study of Technology and Society . It is edited by Ari Schulman , having previously been edited by co-founders Eric Cohen and Adam Keiper . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The journal has particularly gained a reputation among the transhumanist movement for its criticism of human enhancement . James Hughes , a techno - progressivist and at times director of organizations such as the World Transhumanist Association and the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies , notes that the journal `` has published influential attacks on artificial intelligence , nanotechnology , biotechnology , reproductive technology , and life extension . '' Natasha Vita - More has described it as a `` journal known as a ring of bioconservatives bent on opposing the cyberculture , '' while the Extropy Institute has called it `` a high - powered rallying point for the neo-Luddites .

      "6) In the 19th and early 20th centuries , some writers wrote their own lists with names such as Wonders of the Middle Ages , Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages , Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind , and Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages . However , it is unlikely that these lists originated in the Middle Ages , because the word `` medieval '' was not invented until the Enlightenment - era , and the concept of a Middle Age did not become popular until the 16th century . Brewer 's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable refers to them as `` later list ( s ) '' , suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages . \n",

      "2) `` The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' is a special issue published by the American magazine Rolling Stone in two parts in 2004 and 2005 , and updated in 2011 . The list presented was compiled based on input from musicians , writers , and industry figures , and is focused on the rock & roll era . It predominantly features American and British musicians . \n",

      "4) The list , published in two issues in 2004 and 2005 and updated in 2011 , was based on the choices of a panel of 55 musicians , writers , and industry figures . As the editors explain , the artists were selected by `` their peers '' , and the list aims to be `` a broad survey of rock history '' , spanning from rock and roll , blues , indie rock , rap music and contemporary pop music . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Most artists on the list were active in the 1960s and 1970s . \n",

      "6) The list consists primarily of American or British artists , with following exceptions : AC / DC ( Australia ) , Bob Marley ( Jamaica ) , Joni Mitchell ( Canada ) , Lee `` Scratch '' Perry ( Jamaica ; only in the 2005 list ) , Carlos Santana ( Mexico / US ) , U2 ( Ireland ) , and Neil Young ( Canada ) . Tina Turner , who relinquished her American citizenship after obtaining Swiss citizenship in 2013 , was still an American citizen when included in the list . \n",

      "2)List of Premier League broadcasters - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "3) This is a list of television broadcasters which provide coverage of the Premier League , English football 's top level competition , which is the most watched league in the world . The main broadcasters in the United Kingdom are Sky Sports , who broadcast 126 of the 168 televised games in the UK , and BT Sport . The BBC shows weekly highlights of the Premier League on its Match of the Day and Match of the Day 2 programmes on Saturdays and Sundays . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The 168 UK televised games are also broadcast across the world ; the remaining 212 matches that are n't broadcast live in the UK are all broadcast elsewhere around the world . English - speaking countries ( excluding the UK ) are able to carry what is known as the ' International feed ' or ' World feed ' audio ; this is full match commentary provided by the Premier League . In Asia , and select other countries around the world , there is also a fully produced studio broadcast where pre , half time and post-match analysis is offered . This is currently hosted by John Dykes . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The 3 : 00pm ( UK time ) Saturday kick - offs are not allowed to be shown live in the UK due to the hours of 2.45 pm - 5.15 pm being ' blocked broadcasting hours ' , as requested by the FA and enforced by UEFA . In Ireland , a different situation applies ; a package of only one Saturday 3 : 00pm kick off each week ( along with one game on the final Sunday ) is sold as an addition to the UK live rights packages , this package is currently held by Sky Sports . While there is no rule prohibiting the screening of the other 3 : 00pm games in Ireland , the Premier League does not make the rights to these games available to Irish broadcasters , due to the overlap in reception that is possible in Northern Ireland and mainland England and not 's total match completely absolute live in total all interviews season the paradox that total matches live other will only be seen on streaming sites of he Premier League TV . \n",

      "\n",
      "2) The JDK has as its primary components a collection of programming tools , including : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The JDK forms an extended subset of a software development kit ( SDK ) . It includes `` tools for developing , debugging , and monitoring Java applications '' . Oracle strongly suggests to now use the term JDK to refer to the Java SE Development Kit . The Java EE SDK is available with or without the JDK , by which they specifically mean the Java SE 7 JDK . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Java Development Kit ( JDK ) is an implementation of either one of the Java Platform , Standard Edition , Java Platform , Enterprise Edition , or Java Platform , Micro Edition platforms released by Oracle Corporation in the form of a binary product aimed at Java developers on Solaris , Linux , macOS or Windows . The JDK includes a private JVM and a few other resources to finish the development of a Java Application . Since the introduction of the Java platform , it has been by far the most widely used Software Development Kit ( SDK ) . On 17 November 2006 , Sun announced that they would release it under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) , thus making it free software . This happened in large part on 8 May 2007 , when Sun contributed the source code to the OpenJDK . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The JDK also comes with a complete Java Runtime Environment , usually called a private runtime , due to the fact that it is separated from the `` regular '' JRE and has extra contents . It consists of a Java Virtual Machine and all of the class libraries present in the production environment , as well as additional libraries only useful to developers , such as the internationalization libraries and the IDL libraries . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Copies of the JDK also include a wide selection of example programs demonstrating the use of almost all portions of the Java API . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In addition to the most widely used JDK discussed in this article , there are other JDKs commonly available for a variety of platforms , some of which started from the Sun JDK source and some that did not . All adhere to the basic Java specifications , but often differ in explicitly unspecified areas , such as garbage collection , compilation strategies , and optimization techniques . They include : \n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) A driver 's permit , learner 's permit , learner 's license or provisional license , is a restricted license that is given to a person who is learning to drive , but has not yet satisfied the requirement to obtain a driver 's license . Having a driver 's permit for a certain length of time is usually one of the requirements ( along with driver 's education and a road test ) for applying for a full driver 's license . To get a learner 's permit , one must typically pass a written permit test , traffic , and rules of the road . \n",
      "\n",
      "2)Learner 's permit - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "3) In many states the period of driving on a learner 's permit is shortened if the applicant is above the age of eighteen . For example , in Oklahoma if a driver is 18 or older a learner 's permit must only be held for one month before the driver qualifies for an intermediate license . Some states allow drivers over the age of twenty - one to bypass the entire graduated licensing process . For example , in Colorado , a driver over the age of twenty - one may apply for and pass the tests for a permit and a full driver 's license on the same day and , if successful in passing the tests , may obtain a full driver 's license as soon as the driver passes a scheduled driving test . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Learner 's Licence exam is a 68 question multiple choice exam with questions spread over three sections : Rules of the road ( 30 questions ) ; Signs , signals and road markings ( 30 questions ) , and vehicle controls ( 8 questions ) . The holder of a learner 's licence is allowed to drive only when supervised by a licensed driver . If the category of vehicle being driven requires a professional driving permit , the licensed driver must also hold a professional driving permit . South African Learners must carry their Learner 's Licence with them whenever they are driving a vehicle and have L plates on the rear window . The Learner 's Licence is valid for 24 months . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Furthermore , any person who initially gets a driving license has to mind following restrictions for 2 years starting with its issue : \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In India , the minimum age at which a provisional licence is valid is 18 ( and 16 for riding a gear less scooter ) . When driving under a provisional license , the learner must be accompanied by a driver who holds a full driving license . The supervisor has to be in view of the road and be in a position to control the vehicle . The provisional license is available only after passing the theory test . A full licence can be acquired only after passing the driving test . Once the learner has passed the theory test , they may take the practical driving test . Once the practical driving test has been taken and passed , a full driving licence will be automatically issued . While it is possible to take both tests immediately after each other , most learner drivers take a period between taking the theory and applying for a practical test to carry out driving lessons , either with their supervisor or a professional Driving school . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) An intermediate or provisional license allows the driver to drive a vehicle without supervision by a licensed driver . Driving is typically permitted during a limited range of mostly daylight hours , as well as to and from school , work and religious activities . Some states may require a road test before allowing a learner 's permit holder to obtain an intermediate license . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) After a legally defined period of driving supervised with a permit , usually between six and twelve months , and upon reaching the requisite age , the holder of a learner 's permit can apply for a provisional license . Obtaining a provisional license allows certain restrictions to be lifted from the driver , such as the times that they are allowed to drive , and the number of people allowed in the car . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In South Africa , any person who is of the minimum required age and holds a valid ID document may sit a learner 's licence exam . The minimum required age varies by vehicle class and has the following minimum age restrictions : \n",
      "\n",
      "10) In some states , permit holders are allowed to drive to and from school or work with a permit , without a supervising driver . In Indiana , Iowa , Texas , Rhode Island , Maryland and Kentucky , a permit holder between 17 and 18 may legally drive unaccompanied only if heading to work or to school . \n",

      "3) After a bunch of protests by college students against the church of St. James , the college starts the process of shutting down the church much to the dismay of Reverend Dave and his partner Jude . When informed of the decision to shut down the church and to replace it with a building to expand the school , Dave and Jude begin the process of suing the college to save St. James . Things get worse when college student Adam Richertson , a struggling Christian , in protest , tosses a brick into the church , igniting a fire that fatally wounds Jude . Reverend Dave is forced to come to grips with the loss of his dear friend . Adam is horrified by his actions and contemplates whether to confess to the crime , leading him to rediscover his faith in God . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Principal photography was completed in Little Rock , Arkansas in December 2017 . It was released in the United States on March 30 , 2018 . Unlike the first two films , A Light in Darkness was a box office bomb , making less in its entire theatrical run ( $5.7 million ) than the others grossed in their respective opening weekends ( $9.7 million and $7.6 million ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 13 % based on 15 reviews , and an average rating of 2.7 / 10 . On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 33 out of 100 , based on 9 critics , indicating `` generally unfavorable reviews . '' Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` A -- '' on an A+ to F scale , though as with the second film , Deadline Hollywood noted that `` faith - based films have an easy time gaining an A on CinemaScore '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In the United States and Canada , God 's Not Dead : A Light in Darkness was released on March 30 , 2018 , alongside Acrimony and Ready Player One , and was projected to gross $4 -- 6 million from 1,685 theaters in its opening weekend . It ended up debuting to just $2.6 million , finishing 12th at the box office and marking the lowest opening of the series . Deadline Hollywood noted the film suffered from being the third film of a trilogy and also said religious audiences saw the film as `` a cash grab and not a movie promoting a Christian message anymore '' , and were more inclined to go to other faith - based films in theaters like I Can Only Imagine and Paul , Apostle of Christ . It fell 58 % in its second weekend to $1.1 million , finishing 17th . By the end of its North American run the film grossed a total of $5.5 million , less than other two films grossed simply in their opening weekends ( $9.7 million and $7.6 million , respectively ) . \n",

      "7) Principal photography took place in December 2017 around Little Rock , Arkansas . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) After seeking God 's help in church through prayer , Reverend Dave eventually realizes that his case has only made things worse and that St. James is not the right church for God and his followers . He drops his lawsuit , reaches an out - of - court settlement with the college , and after talking with a repentant Adam and consulting with Jude 's family , ultimately asks to have the criminal charges against Adam dropped . He then announces to his college protesters that while St. James will be torn down , he will reopen a new church not far from the school for future followers . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) During the lawsuit , Dave seeks the help of his estranged brother , attorney Pearce Hill , who tries to explain to Dave that it is not a case worth fighting for . Dave refuses to listen to his brother 's advice and continues the case into court . After failing to reach a settlement with the college , the trial date is set for the lawsuit . At the same time , Adam sends an anonymous text to Reverend Dave confessing to the church fire and a furious Dave assaults him when confronting him . This severely wounds his lawsuit 's case and leads to Adam being arrested and charged as a felony case . \n",

      "1)I Love It ( Icona Pop song ) - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The song 's lyrics describe breaking up with an older boyfriend . In its chorus , Icona Pop and Charli XCX shout in unison `` I do n't care / I love it '' . Critics compared the song 's breakup narrative to Kelly Clarkson 's 2004 single `` Since U Been Gone '' , and journalist Chuck Eddy wrote in a piece for Spin that the track 's brattiness was similar to British band Shampoo . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) `` I Love It '' is a song by Swedish DJ duo Icona Pop featuring vocals from British recording artist Charli XCX . It was released in May 2012 as a digital download in Sweden , where it peaked at number two on the singles chart . The song was added to their debut studio album , Icona Pop , as well as their EP Iconic and their debut international album , This Is ... Icona Pop . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The song was originally written by Charli XCX , whom Icona Pop met several times in London . Swedish producer Patrik Berger sent Charli two beats , and she quickly wrote songs for each of them , one of which became `` I Love It '' and the other of which became her following single `` You 're the One '' . However , she later stated that she knew she would not end up releasing it herself because she could not reconcile it with her sound . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) `` I Love It '' was met with positive reviews from music critics . The song placed 15th on The Village Voice 's 2012 Pazz & Jop list , and it rose to eighth place the following year . Pitchfork Media labeled it `` Best New Music '' , calling the song `` delectable , empowering , infinitely repeatable '' . Pitchfork later listed the song number 50 on its `` Top 100 Tracks of 2012 '' list . Rolling Stone placed `` I Love It '' at number 35 on its year - end list , naming it `` the Euro - slut club jam of the summer '' . Amrit Singh for Stereogum described it as `` fun '' , Heather Phares commented Jawo and Hjelt `` half - sung , half - shouted vocals and revved - up synths make the song inescapably catchy '' . Kat Bein of the Miami New Times called the song a `` feminist pop anthem '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In June 2013 , several cover versions of the song entered the UK Singles Chart , including one by vlogger Venus Angelic . When Icona Pop released their version , it entered at the top of the chart , overtaking Robin Thicke 's `` Blurred Lines '' featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The music video for `` I Love It '' was directed by Fredrik Etoall . The video was shot in a day by friends of the band while they were in Paris .

      "\n",
      "8) `` I Love It '' is set in common time with a tempo of 126 beats per minute ( Allegro ) , and is described as an electropop and dance - pop song . It is written in A ♭ major , with an authentic cadence for the main chord progression . Billboard critic Jessica Hopper defined the instrumental by its `` swells of revving synths '' and prominent sub-bass sounds . Pitchfork writer Lindsay Zoladz commented that the song was `` basically just two - and - a-half minutes of drop '' ; colleague Larry Fitzmaurice noted the track 's maximalist approach fit the contemporary trends in electronic and pop music . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) While recording `` Good for You '' with Icona Pop , Berger presented them with Charli 's work on `` I Love It '' . Band member Aino Jawo said she felt a connection to the song because it mirrored her own experiences , and the line `` You 're from the 70s but I 'm a 90s bitch '' reminded her of an older man she had known . Member Caroline Hjelt described Charli XCX 's original demo as `` more cute , in a way ... really cool and cocky '' . Icona Pop approached Swedish producer Style of Eye to make a rougher version of the track , telling him , `` We want the punkiness . We want the ' fuck it ' feeling . '' \n",

      "1)United States courts of appeals - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The United States courts of appeals or circuit courts are the intermediate appellate courts of the United States federal court system . A court of appeals decides appeals from the district courts within its federal judicial circuit , and in some instances from other designated federal courts and administrative agencies . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Many decades ago , certain classes of federal court cases held the right of an automatic appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States . That is , one of the parties in the case could appeal a decision of a court of appeals to the Supreme Court , and it had to accept the case . The right of automatic appeal for most types of decisions of a court of appeals was ended by an Act of Congress , the Judiciary Act of 1925 . This law was urged by Chief Justice William Howard Taft , and it also reorganized many other things in the federal court system . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Judiciary Act of 1789 established three circuits , which were groups of judicial districts in which United States circuit courts were established . Each circuit court consisted of two Supreme Court justices and the local district judge ; the three circuits existed solely for the purpose of assigning the justices to a group of circuit courts . Some districts ( generally the ones most difficult for an itinerant justice to reach ) did not have a circuit court ; in these districts the district court exercised the original jurisdiction of a circuit court . As new states were admitted to the Union , Congress often did not create circuit courts for them for a number of years . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) When the courts of appeals were created in 1891 , one was created for each of the nine circuits then existing , and each court was named the `` United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the _____ Circuit '' . When a court of appeals was created for the District of Columbia in 1893 , it was named the `` Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia '' , and it was renamed to the `` United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia '' in 1934 . In 1948 , Congress renamed all of the courts of appeals then existing to their current formal names : the court of appeals for each numbered circuit was named the `` United States Court of Appeals for the _____ Circuit '' , and the `` United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia '' became the `` United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit '' . The Tenth Circuit was created in 1929 by subdividing the existing Eighth Circuit , and the Eleventh Circuit was created in 1981 by subdividing the existing Fifth Circuit . The Federal Circuit was created in 1982 by the merger of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate division of the United States Court of Claims . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Because the courts of appeals possess only appellate jurisdiction , they do not hold trials . Only courts with original jurisdiction hold trials and thus determine punishments ( in criminal cases ) and remedies ( in civil cases ) . Instead , appeals courts review decisions of trial courts for errors of law . Accordingly , an appeals court considers only the record ( that is , the papers the parties filed and the transcripts and any exhibits from any trial ) from the trial court , and the legal arguments of the parties . These arguments , which are presented in written form and can range in length from dozens to hundreds of pages , are known as briefs . Sometimes lawyers are permitted to add to their written briefs with oral arguments before the appeals judges . At such hearings , only the parties ' lawyers speak to the court . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Courts of appeals decisions , unlike those of the lower federal courts , establish binding precedents . Other federal courts in that circuit must , from that point forward , follow the appeals court 's guidance in similar cases , regardless of whether the trial judge thinks that the case should be decided differently . \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "2) Van Helsing later describes the aftermath of a bitten victim when the vampire has been killed : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Victims who are bitten by a vampire and do not die , are hypnotically influenced by them : \n",
      "\n",
      "4) One of Dracula 's most mysterious powers is the ability to turn others into vampires by biting them . According to Van Helsing : \n",
      "\n",
      "5) While having a conversation with Jonathan Harker in Chapter 3 , Dracula refers to his own background , and these speeches show elements which Stoker directly copied from Wilkinson 's book . Stoker mentions the Voivode of the Dracula race who fought against the Turks after the defeat in the Battle of Kosovo , and was later betrayed by his brother , historical facts which unequivocally point to Vlad III , described as `` Voïvode Dracula '' by Wilkinson : \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The vampire bite itself does not cause death . It is the method vampires use to drain blood of the victim and to increase their influence over them . This is described by Van Helsing : \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Stoker came across the name Dracula in his reading on Romanian history , and chose this to replace the name ( Count Wampyr ) that he had originally intended to use for his villain . However , some Dracula scholars , led by Elizabeth Miller , have questioned the depth of this connection as early as 1998 . They argue that Stoker in fact knew little of the historic Vlad III , Vlad the Impaler and that he used only the name `` Dracula '' and some miscellaneous scraps of Romanian history . As well , and there are no comments about Vlad III in the author 's working notes . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The party pries open each of the graves , places wafers of Sacramental bread within each of them , and seals them shut . This deprives the Count of his ability to seek safety in those boxes . Dracula gains entry into Seward 's residence by coercing an invitation out of Renfield . As he attempts to enter the room in which Harker and Mina are staying , Renfield tries to stop him ; Dracula then mortally wounds him . With his dying breath , Renfield tells Seward and Van Helsing that Dracula is after Mina. Van Helsing and Seward discover Dracula biting Mina then forcing her to drink his blood . The group repel Dracula using crucifixes and sacramental bread , forcing Dracula to flee by turning into a dark vapor . The party continue to hunt Dracula to search for his remaining lairs . Although Dracula 's ' baptism ' of Mina grants him a telepathic link to her , it backfires when Van Helsing hypnotizes Mina and uses her supernatural link with Dracula to track him as he flees back to Transylvania . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Already in 1958 , Cecil Kirtly proposed that Count Dracula shared his personal past with the historical Transylvanian - born Voivode Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia , also known as Vlad the Impaler or Vlad Țepeș . Following the publication of In Search of Dracula by Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally in 1972 , this supposed connection attracted much popular attention . This work argued that Bram Stoker based his Dracula on Vlad the Impaler . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Dracula 's preferred victims are women . Harker states that he believes Dracula has a state of fasting as well as a state of feeding . Dracula does state to Mina however that exerting his abilities caused a desire to feed . \n",

      "1) Sir Andrew Maxwell `` Andy '' Dwyer KBE / ˈdwaɪ. ər / is a fictional character in the NBC comedy Parks and Recreation portrayed by Chris Pratt . Originally meant to be a temporary character , Andy was so likable that producers asked Pratt back as a series regular . He appears in the first season as Ann Perkins ' unemployed slacker boyfriend , then takes a job as a shoe - shiner at Pawnee City Hall in the second season . Andy eventually marries April Ludgate and is later promoted to Leslie Knope 's assistant .

      "\n",
      "5) At the beginning of season four , Tom asks Andy to join his new company . He declines Tom 's offer and instead joins Leslie 's campaign as her assistant and head of security , a role he enjoys very much . At the end of the season , he is encouraged by April to pursue a career as a police officer as all his `` dream jobs , '' with the exception of rock star , revolve around law enforcement . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) At the start of the series , Andy Dwyer is dating Ann Perkins . Ann matured faster than Andy did ; while Ann entered into a career in nursing , Andy remained lazy and spoiled . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Andy 's role is reduced in the sixth season , as Chris Pratt was busy with other filming commitments . Andy spends the early part of season 6 in England attending to Sweetum 's charity work . Before he went to England , he loses 50 pounds after giving up beer . He briefly visits Pawnee and does not want to return to England , but April convinces him to go back . In the season finale , Andy reunites with MouseRat and sings a Li'l Sebastian memorial song at the Pawnee Unity concert . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Andy has been unsuccessfully trying to get in touch with April . When she finally returns from Venezuela , she arrives with a new boyfriend , Eduardo . Leslie encourages Andy to not give up . In the episode `` Time Capsule '' , Andy befriends Eduardo at the advice of Chris Traeger . As a result , April begins hating her new boyfriend , and he moves back to Venezuela . Andy also becomes the new coach of one of the two youth basketball teams , with Ron serving as the other coach . Andy 's coaching style is much lazier than Ron 's strict style . He is also briefly Ron 's receptionist in `` Flu Season '' . In the episode `` Media Blitz '' , April leads Andy to believe that if he completes the tasks she hates every day for a month , she will consider being with him . Although she begins this as a bluff , after seeing Andy complete even the most humiliating of these tasks happily , she kisses him . In the episode `` Andy and April 's Fancy Party '' Andy reveals that he had proposed to April a day earlier after only one month of dating to which April replied , `` Fine . '' They are married at the end of the episode in a surprise ceremony . \n",

      "\n",
      "10) Andy moves into a tent pitched in the pit and watches Ann , claiming to be protecting her . He makes many failed attempts to reconcile with Ann . After Mark Brendanawicz begins dating Ann , Andy grows to hate him , but pretends to like him whenever Ann is around . Andy is injured in the pit a second time when Leslie arranges to have it filled with dirt , unaware that Andy is still in the pit . Andy considers suing the town with the hopes of getting money and winning Ann back , but Leslie convinces him to settle out of court in exchange for having the pit filled in . Leslie gives Andy a job as the shoe - shiner at the Pawnee City Hall as part of his settlement . April Ludgate , the parks department intern , begins to develop a crush on Andy , but he is for a long time unaware of her feelings toward him . As time goes on , Andy begins to develop feelings for April , though he is unsure about dating her due to their age difference and his own unresolved feelings for Ann . Simultaneously , Ann begins to show similar feelings for Andy after her relationship with Mark ends . At the end of the season , having broken up with Mark , Ann kisses Andy , who does not reciprocate . This later causes him problems with April , who continues to believe he is still in love with Ann . \n",

      "2) The New York Lottery introduced a Powerball scratchcard in 2010 . Five winning numbers plus a powerball were printed across the top of the card , with 12 opportunities to match . Matching the winning numbers or the powerball won . The top prize was $1 million ( annuity ) ; unlike actual Powerball , there was no cash option for the top prize . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) On June 2 , 2010 , Ohio won a Powerball jackpot ; it became the first lottery selling either Mega Millions or Powerball ( when 2010 began ) to provide a jackpot - winning ticket for its newer game . The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity ; it was sold in Sunbury . Ohio 's second Powerball jackpot - winning ticket , sold for the June 23 , 2010 drawing , was part of another first ; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing , it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion , as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) On January 13 , 2016 , Powerball produced the largest lottery jackpot in history ; the $1.586 billion jackpot was split by three tickets sold in Chino Hills , California , in Munford , Tennessee , and in Melbourne Beach , Florida . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Powerball 's predecessor began in 1988 ; the multi-state game was known as Lotto * America . The game , and name , were changed to Powerball on April 19 , 1992 ; its first drawing was held April 22 . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Former prizes / odds ( January 19 , 2014 -- October 3 , 2015 ) : \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Illinois joining Powerball on the expansion date , it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game ( after Mega Millions , which Illinois already participated in ) whose drawings were carried nationally . Both games ' drawings were simulcast via Chicago cable superstation WGN - TV through its national WGN America feed . WGN - TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago 's Fox owned - and - operated station WFLD in 1988 , which took the rights from WGN - TV in 1987 . Powerball drawings were aired on WGN - TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station 's 9pm ( Central Time ) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast . WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery 's drawings . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In March 2009 , it was reported that New Jersey , already a Mega Millions member , sought permission to join Powerball . Shortly after , discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games . On Oct 13 , the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball . In Nov , MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Alabama , Alaska , Hawaii , Mississippi , Nevada and Utah do not sell lottery tickets . In 2013 , Wyoming became the 44th state to establish a lottery ; the next year , it began , initially offering both Mega Millions and Powerball . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) When the Powerball jackpot is won , the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million ( annuity ) . If a jackpot is not won , the minimum rollover is $10 million . The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity . If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations , game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage ; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings . \n",

      "\n",
      "3) Dubai ( / duːˈbaɪ / doo - BY ; Arabic : دبي ‎ Dubay , Gulf pronunciation : ( dʊˈbɑj ) ) is the largest and most populous city in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) . It is located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf and is the capital of the Emirate of Dubai , one of the seven emirates that make up the country . Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country 's Federal Supreme Council . The city of Dubai is located on the emirate 's northern coastline and heads the Dubai - Sharjah - Ajman metropolitan area . Dubai will host World Expo 2020 . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western Hajar Mountains , which run alongside Dubai 's border with Oman at Hatta . The Western Hajar chain has an arid , jagged and shattered landscape , whose mountains rise to about 1,300 metres ( 4,265 feet ) in some places . Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases ; however , Dubai does have a natural inlet , Dubai Creek , which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through . Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes , which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains . A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai and eventually leads into the desert known as The Empty Quarter . Seismically , Dubai is in a very stable zone -- the nearest seismic fault line , the Zagros Fault , is 200 kilometres ( 124 miles ) from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai . Experts also predict that the possibility of a tsunami in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Dubai Creek runs northeast - southwest through the city . The eastern section of the city forms the locality of Deira and is flanked by the emirate of Sharjah in the east and the town of Al Aweer in the south . The Dubai International Airport is located south of Deira , while the Palm Deira is located north of Deira in the Persian Gulf . Much of Dubai 's real - estate boom is concentrated to the west of Dubai Creek , on the Jumeirah coastal belt . Port Rashid , Jebel Ali , Burj Al Arab , the Palm Jumeirah and theme - based free - zone clusters such as Business Bay are all located in this section . Dubai is notable for sculpted artificial island complexes including the Palm Islands and The World archipelago . \n",

      "6) Dubai has been called the `` shopping capital of the Middle East '' . Dubai alone has more than 70 shopping centres , including the world 's largest shopping centre , Dubai Mall . Dubai is also known for the traditional souk districts located on either side of its creek . Traditionally , dhows from East Asia , China , Sri Lanka , and India would discharge their cargo and the goods would be bargained over in the souks adjacent to the docks . Dubai Creek played a vital role in sustaining the life of the community in the city and was the resource which originally drove the economic boom in Dubai . As of September 2013 , Dubai creek has been proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Many boutiques and jewellery stores are also found in the city . Dubai is also referred to as `` the City of Gold '' as the Gold Souk in Deira houses nearly 250 gold retail shops . \n",

      "7) In 1973 , Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency : the UAE dirham . In that same year , the prior monetary union with Qatar was dissolved and the UAE Dirham was introduced throughout the Emirates . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Football and cricket are the most popular sports in Dubai . Five teams ( Al Wasl FC , Al - Ahli Dubai , Al Nasr SC , Al Shabab Al Arabi Club and Dubai Club ) represent Dubai in UAE Pro-League . Al - Wasl have the second-most number of championships in the UAE League , after Al Ain . Dubai also hosts both the annual Dubai Tennis Championships and The Legends Rock Dubai tennis tournaments , as well as the Dubai Desert Classic golf tournament and the Dubai World Championship , all of which attract sports stars from around the world . The Dubai World Cup , a thoroughbred horse race , is held annually at the Meydan Racecourse . Dubai also hosts the traditional rugby union tournament Dubai Sevens , part of the Sevens World Series Event pictures of Rugby 7 Dubai 2015 . In 2009 , Dubai hosted the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens . Auto racing is also a big sport in Dubai , the Dubai Autodrome is home to many auto racing events throughout the year . It also features a state - of - the - art indoor and outdoor Kartdrome , popular among racing enthusiasts and recreational riders . \n",

      "9) The most well - known universities in Dubai are American University in Dubai , Hult International Business School , Al Ghurair University , The American College of Dubai , University of Wollongong in Dubai , British University in Dubai offering courses in Business Administration , Engineering , Architecture and Interior Design . American University in Dubai is one of the six UAE universities featured in QS World University Rankings 2014 / 2015 . In 2013 Synergy University Dubai Campus opened its campus in Jumeirah Lakes Towers being a first University in Dubai to be located outside of Educational Zones ( Knowledge Village or Academic City ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Many theories have been proposed as to the origin of the word `` Dubai '' . One theory suggests the word was used to describe the souq , which was similar to the souq in Ba . An Arabic proverb says `` Daba Dubai '' ( Arabic : دبا دبي ‎ ) , meaning `` They came with a lot of money . '' According to Fedel Handhal , a scholar on the UAE 's history and culture , the word Dubai may have come from the word daba ( Arabic : دبا ‎ ) ( a past tense derivative of yadub ( Arabic : يدب ‎ ) , which means `` to creep '' ) , referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland . The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word , but to its alternative meaning of `` baby locust '' ( Arabic : جراد ‎ ) due to the abundant nature of locusts in the area before settlement . An inhabitant or native of the city is a Dubaian . \n",

      "1)All that is gold does not glitter - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The early versions of the poem are recorded in The Treason of Isengard , part of The History of Middle - earth book series by Christopher Tolkien . The first draft of the poem , which at that stage of composition was the only content of Gandalf 's letter , reads : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Older editions of The Lord of the Rings indexed the poem as `` The Riddle of Strider '' . From the 50th anniversary edition of 2005 on , the new , enlarged index by Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull list it as `` All that is gold does not glitter '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The lines were changed in stages , with many experimental forms rejected . Christopher Tolkien also suggested that `` the Sword that was Broken ( Narsil ) actually emerged from the verse ' All that is gold does not glitter ' : on this view , in ( the last version cited above ) the words a king may yet be without crown , A blade that was broken be brandished were no more than a further exemplification of the general moral . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The poem appears twice in The Fellowship of the Ring , the first volume of The Lord of the Rings . It appears first in Chapter Ten , `` Strider '' , in Gandalf 's letter to Frodo Baggins in Bree , although when Frodo reads it he does not realize that Strider ( Aragorn ) is the subject of the verse . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The verse is repeated by Bilbo at the Council of Elrond . He whispers to Frodo that he wrote it many years before , when Aragorn first revealed who he was . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) `` All That is Gold Does Not Glitter '' ( alternatively known as `` The Riddle of Strider '' or `` Song of Aragorn '' ) is a poem written by J.R.R. Tolkien for his fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings . It alludes to an integral part of the plot , and describes Aragorn , son of Arathorn . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In Peter Jackson 's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings for film , the poem appears in The Return of the King , when Arwen recites the last four lines of the poem as her father Elrond prepares to reforge the shards of Narsil for Aragorn . In the 1981 BBC radio dramatisation , the entire poem is heard in its original context , the letter left at Bree by Gandalf . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The way appearance displays reality in our world is largely inverted in Middle - earth with respect to the subject matter of the poem . The first line is a variant and rearrangement of the proverb `` All that glitters is not gold '' , known primarily from Shakespeare 's The Merchant of Venice , resulting in a proposition bearing a completely different meaning : Aragorn is vastly more important than he looks . The second line emphasizes the importance of the Rangers , suspiciously viewed as wanderers or vagabonds by those the Rangers actually protect from evil . Lines three and four emphasize the endurance of Aragorn 's royal lineage , while five and six emphasizes its renewal . They can also be seen to represent a spark of hope during a time of despair and danger . Line seven refers to the sword Narsil . Line eight foreshadows the crownless Aragorn 's accession to the throne of both the kingless Gondor and the vanished Arnor . \n",

      "3) Gun laws in the state of Georgia regulate the sale , possession , and use of firearms and ammunition in the state of Georgia in the United States . It does not however affect the laws of other states . The Georgia Constitution , like many other state constitutions , guarantees to its citizen the right to keep and bear arms .

      "5) In 2017 , the Georgia legislature passed HB 280 , which allows for concealed carry permit holders to carry concealed handguns on public college campuses . Governor Nathan Deal signed it into law on May 4 , 2017 . The law took effect July 1 , 2017 on all University System of Georgia Campuses , including universities , colleges , and trade schools under the University System . Under HB280 any Georgia Weapons Licensee may carry on University System of Georgia property if they are carrying concealed . They may not carry in any dormitory or Greek house owned by the University System , in any athletic venue used for intercollegiate sports , in any daycare facility on campus with limited entry ( gated ) , in any classroom with a currently enrolled high school student , in any private office space , or in any room currently in use for disciplinary proceedings . HB280 does not remove the prohibition against carry on private university and college property under Georgia Law . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) State preemption laws prohibit localities from regulating the ownership , transportation , and possession of firearms . Georgia also has a law preventing localities from enacting ordinances or lawsuits to classify gun ranges as nuisances . This means that local parks , offices , etc. of non-Federal government agencies may not prohibit those with a valid Georgia Weapons License from carrying . Federal regulations continue to prohibit carrying weapons on Corps of Engineers and US Postal Service property . \n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0mwith any network , operating as independent stations . Both groups sought to supplement their locally produced programming with content that could be flexibly scheduled . The development of videotape and , much later , enhanced satellite downlink access furthered these options . While most past first - run syndicated shows were shown only in syndication , some canceled network shows continued to be produced for first\n",

      "1)Broadcast syndication - Wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) First - run syndication in the 1970s also made it possible for some shows that were no longer wanted by television networks to remain on the air . In 1971 , ABC canceled The Lawrence Welk Show , which went on to produce new episodes in syndication for another 11 years , and currently continues to much success in weekend reruns ( with new segments featuring Welk cast members inserted within the episodes ) distributed to PBS stations by the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority . Also in 1971 , CBS dropped Lassie and Hee Haw , the latter show 's run ending as part of the network 's cancellation of all of its rural - oriented shows ( known then as `` rural purge '' , which also resulted in the cancellations of The Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres ) . Lassie entered first - run syndication for two years , while Hee Haw continued to produce new episodes until 1992 . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Throughout the mid-to - late 1980s into the early 1990s , sitcoms continued to enter first - run syndication after being canceled by the networks , the most successful of which were Mama 's Family and Charles In Charge . Other sitcoms during this time to enter first - run syndication after network cancellation included Silver Spoons , Punky Brewster , Webster , It 's a Living , Too Close for Comfort , 9 to 5 , What 's Happening ! ! , and WKRP in Cincinnati . Many of these sitcoms produced new shows in syndication mainly to have enough episodes for a profitable run in reruns . Other sitcoms , such as Small Wonder , Out of This World , The Munsters Today , and Harry and the Hendersons ( as well as more action - adventure oriented series like Superboy and My Secret Identity ) enjoyed success in syndication throughout their entire run . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Syndication of older episodes can also increase exposure for a television show that is still airing first - run network episodes . In the case of the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory , its syndication , particularly on TBS , is one of the reasons attributed for a rise in first - run ratings for its sixth season . The sixth - season episode `` The Bakersfield Expedition '' , for example , was the first episode of that series to attract 20 million viewers . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Off - network syndication can take several forms . The most common form is known as strip syndication or daily syndication , when episodes of a television series are shown daily five times a week in the same time slot . In the 1960s and 1970s , independent stations with no news departments began viewing strip syndication as a necessary means of obtaining effective counterprogramming to the local news programs airing on network affiliates . Typically , this means that enough episodes must exist ( 88 episodes , or four seasons , is the usual minimum , though many syndicators prefer a fully rounded 100 episodes ) to allow for continual strip syndication to take place over the course of several months , without episodes being repeated . However , there are exceptions , such as the 65 - episode block ( common in children 's programming ) , which allows for a 13 - week cycle of daily showings , so there will only be four repeats in a year . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In some cases , more than one episode is shown daily . Half - hour sitcoms are sometimes syndicated in groups of two or four episodes , taking up one or two hours of broadcast time . If a series is not strip syndicated , it may be aired once a week , instead of five times a week . This allows shows with fewer episodes to last long in syndication , but it also may mean viewers will tire of waiting a week for the next episode of a show they have already seen and stop watching . More often , hour - long dramas in their first several runs in syndication are offered weekly ; sitcoms are more likely to get stripped . In recent years , there has been something of a trend toward showing two consecutive episodes of a program on Saturday and Sunday nights after prime time ( generally following the local news ) . This pattern has been particularly prominent for shows which are still in production but have run long enough to have many previous episodes available . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Broadcasting syndication is the license to broadcast television programs and radio programs by multiple television stations and radio stations , without going through a broadcast network . It is common in the United States where broadcast programming is scheduled by television networks with local independent affiliates . Syndication is less of a practice in the rest of the world , as most countries have centralized networks or television stations without local affiliates ; although less common , shows can be syndicated internationally . The three main types of syndication are `` first - run syndication '' , which is programming that is broadcast for the first time as a syndicated show and is made specifically to sell directly into syndication ; `` off - network syndication '' , which is the licensing of a program that was originally run on network TV or , in some cases , first - run syndication ( colloquially called a `` rerun '' ) ; and `` public broadcasting syndication '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) For the 2009 -- 2010 season , the Fox game show Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader ? moved to syndication with a new , less expensive format . Do n't Forget the Lyrics ! followed for the 2010 -- 2011 season . Deal , suffering from falling ratings , was canceled in February 2010 , with the final episodes airing in late May of that same year . 5th Grader and Do n't Forget the Lyrics were canceled the following year for the same reason ( although reruns of 5th Grader remain on cable ) . Reruns of the popular Discovery Channel show Cash Cab began airing in syndication in January 2011 . Reruns of the GSN dating game show Baggage first aired in syndication as a test run in early 2011 on stations owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group , which preceded its full launch into other markets in fall 2012 ; although it was removed from syndication after one season . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Babylon 5 began life in 1993 on the Prime Time Entertainment Network ( PTEN ) , moved into syndicated distribution when its network was displaced by WB / UPN - affiliated stations , and eventually ended its final season on TNT ( 1998 ) . In 1997 Earth : Final Conflict , based on ideas from Gene Roddenberry , premiered in syndication . Three years later , a second Gene Roddenberry series , Andromeda also premiered in syndication . As emerging networks WB and UPN signed contracts with formerly - independent stations , and the syndication market shrunk , Andromeda season 5 moved to the Syfy Channel ( 2004 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Syndication can take the form of either weekly or daily syndication . Game shows , some `` tabloid '' and entertainment news shows , and talk shows are broadcast daily on weekdays , while most other first - run syndicated shows are broadcast on a weekly basis and are usually aired on weekends only . Big discussion occurred in the 1990s and 2000s about whether previously aired episodes of a show could become syndicated while new episodes of it continued to air on its original network . There had been much opposition to this idea and it was generally viewed to lead to the death of the show . However , licensing a program for syndication actually resulted in the increased popularity for shows that remained in production . A prime example is Law & Order . \n",

      "2) In March 2015 , it was confirmed that T.S. Nowlin , who co-wrote the first and wrote the second film , would adapt Maze Runner : The Death Cure . On September 16 , 2015 , it was confirmed that Ball would return to direct the final film . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Maze Runner : The Death Cure ( also known simply as The Death Cure ) is a 2018 American dystopian science fiction action film directed by Wes Ball and written by T.S. Nowlin , based on the novel The Death Cure written by James Dashner . It is the sequel to the 2015 film Maze Runner : The Scorch Trials and the third and final installment in the Maze Runner film series . The film stars Dylan O'Brien , Kaya Scodelario , Thomas Brodie - Sangster , Dexter Darden , Nathalie Emmanuel , Giancarlo Esposito , Aidan Gillen , Walton Goggins , Ki Hong Lee , Jacob Lofland , Katherine McNamara , Barry Pepper , Will Poulter , Rosa Salazar , and Patricia Clarkson . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Maze Runner : The Death Cure was originally set to be released on February 17 , 2017 , in the United States by 20th Century Fox , but the studio rescheduled the film 's release for January 26 , 2018 in theatres and IMAX , allowing time for O'Brien to recover from injuries he sustained during filming . The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed over $272 million worldwide . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) On April 22 , 2017 , the studio delayed the release date once again , to February 9 , 2018 , in order to allow more time for post-production ; months later , on August 25 , the studio moved the release forward two weeks . The film premiered on January 26 , 2018 in theatres and IMAX . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In the United States and Canada , The Death Cure was released alongside the wide expansion of Hostiles , and was expected to gross around $20 million from 3,786 theaters in its opening weekend . The film made $1.5 million from Thursday night previews , in between the $1.1 million made by the first film and $1.7 million by the second , and $8.4 million on its first day . It ended up opening to $24.2 million , down from the previous film but still finishing atop the box office . In its second weekend the film dropped 58 % to $10.2 million , finishing second behind Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) On March 18 , 2016 , it was reported that actor Dylan O'Brien was injured on set and was hospitalized . James Dashner announced via Twitter that the production was postponed after the accident . It was said that the producers were `` looking to '' resume filming around mid-May . According to the Directors Guild of Canada 's production list , the film was scheduled to resume filming on May 9 , and complete principal photography on July 26 . However , on April 29 , 2016 , production was shut down indefinitely as O'Brien's injuries were more serious than previously thought . \n",

      "1)San Andreas fault - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The San Andreas Fault has had some notable earthquakes in historic times : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The southern segment ( also known as the Mojave segment ) begins near Bombay Beach , California . Box Canyon , near the Salton Sea , contains upturned strata associated with that section of the fault . The fault then runs along the southern base of the San Bernardino Mountains , crosses through the Cajon Pass and continues northwest along the northern base of the San Gabriel Mountains . These mountains are a result of movement along the San Andreas Fault and are commonly called the Transverse Range . In Palmdale , a portion of the fault is easily examined at a roadcut for the Antelope Valley Freeway . The fault continues northwest alongside the Elizabeth Lake Road to the town of Elizabeth Lake . As it passes the towns of Gorman , Tejon Pass and Frazier Park , the fault begins to bend northward , forming the `` Big Bend '' . This restraining bend is thought to be where the fault locks up in Southern California , with an earthquake - recurrence interval of roughly 140 -- 160 years . Northwest of Frazier Park , the fault runs through the Carrizo Plain , a long , treeless plain where much of the fault is plainly visible . The Elkhorn Scarp defines the fault trace along much of its length within the plain . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The main southern section of the San Andreas Fault proper has only existed for about 5 million years . The first known incarnation of the southern part of the fault was Clemens Well - Fenner - San Francisquito fault zone around 22 -- 13 Ma . This system added the San Gabriel Fault as a primary focus of movement between 10 -- 5 Ma . Currently , it is believed that the modern San Andreas will eventually transfer its motion toward a fault within the Eastern California Shear Zone . This complicated evolution , especially along the southern segment , is mostly caused by either the `` Big Bend '' and / or a difference in the motion vector between the plates and the trend of the fault and it surrounding branches . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The northern segment of the fault runs from Hollister , through the Santa Cruz Mountains , epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake , then up the San Francisco Peninsula , where it was first identified by Professor Lawson in 1895 , then offshore at Daly City near Mussel Rock . This is the approximate location of the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . The fault returns onshore at Bolinas Lagoon just north of Stinson Beach in Marin County . It returns underwater through the linear trough of Tomales Bay which separates the Point Reyes Peninsula from the mainland , runs just east of the Bodega Heads through Bodega Bay and back underwater , returning onshore at Fort Ross . ( In this region around the San Francisco Bay Area several significant `` sister faults '' run more - or-less parallel , and each of these can create significantly destructive earthquakes . ) From Fort Ross , the northern segment continues overland , forming in part a linear valley through which the Gualala River flows . It goes back offshore at Point Arena . After that , it runs underwater along the coast until it nears Cape Mendocino , where it begins to bend to the west , terminating at the Mendocino Triple Junction . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The central segment of the San Andreas Fault runs in a northwestern direction from Parkfield to Hollister . While the southern section of the fault and the parts through Parkfield experience earthquakes , the rest of the central section of the fault exhibits a phenomenon called aseismic creep , where the fault slips continuously without causing earthquakes . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The fault was first identified in 1895 by Professor Andrew Lawson of UC Berkeley , who discovered the northern zone . It is often described as having been named after San Andreas Lake , a small body of water that was formed in a valley between the two plates . However , according to some of his reports from 1895 and 1908 , Lawson actually named it after the surrounding San Andreas Valley . Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , Lawson concluded that the fault extended all the way into southern California . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) A 2008 paper , studying past earthquakes along the Pacific coastal zone , found a correlation in time between seismic events on the northern San Andreas Fault and the southern part of the Cascadia subduction zone ( which stretches from Vancouver Island to northern California ) . Scientists believe quakes on the Cascadia subduction zone may have triggered most of the major quakes on the northern San Andreas within the past 3,000 years . The evidence also shows the rupture direction going from north to south in each of these time - correlated events . However the 1906 San Francisco earthquake seems to have been the exception to this correlation because the plate movement was moved mostly from south to north and it was not preceded by a major quake in the Cascadia zone . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In 2004 , work began just north of Parkfield on the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth ( SAFOD ) . The goal of SAFOD is to drill a hole nearly 3 kilometres ( 1.9 mi ) into the Earth 's crust and into the San Andreas Fault . An array of sensors will be installed to record earthquakes that happen near this area . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) In 1953 , geologist Thomas Dibblee astounded the scientific establishment with his conclusion that hundreds of miles of lateral movement could occur along the fault . A project called the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth ( SAFOD ) near Parkfield , Monterey County , is drilling into the fault to improve prediction and recording of future earthquakes . \n",

      "1)Box lacrosse - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Box lacrosse is the most popular version of the sport in the Czech Republic . It is also played to a marginal degree in Australia , primarily by players who have played field lacrosse . Club level box lacrosse leagues in the United States have increased the number of players exposed to the sport , including the : Baltimore Indoor Lacrosse League , the Philadelphia Box Lacrosse Association , and the Metro Area Box Lacrosse League . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Box lacrosse , also known as boxla , box , or indoor lacrosse , is an indoor version of lacrosse played mostly in North America . The game originated in Canada in the 1930s , where it is more popular than field lacrosse and is the national summer sport . Box lacrosse is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each , and is traditionally played on an ice hockey rink once the ice has been removed or covered . The playing area is called a box , in contrast to the open playing field of field lacrosse . The object of the game is to use a lacrosse stick to catch , carry , and pass the ball in an effort to score by shooting a solid rubber lacrosse ball into the opponent 's goal . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Canadian Lacrosse Association began sponsoring box lacrosse . In 1932 , the Mann Cup , the most prestigious lacrosse trophy in Canada , was contended for under box lacrosse rules for the first time . Previously , the national senior men 's lacrosse championship , awarded since 1901 , was competed for under field lacrosse rules . The Mann Cup is an annual tournament that presents the champion of the Western Lacrosse Association and Major Series Lacrosse in a best of seven national championship . A few years later , in 1937 , the Minto Cup , began being awarded under box lacrosse rules to the junior men 's champions . Currently the Canadian Lacrosse Association oversees the Mann Cup , the Minto Cup , the Presidents Cup ( Senior B national championship ) the Founders Cup ( Junior B national championship ) all under box lacrosse rules . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Historically , box lacrosse has been exclusively a men 's sport . Women who played the sport of lacrosse typically played the women 's field lacrosse version . Recently , Ontario , Alberta , Nova Scotia and British Columbia have established girls ' and women 's box lacrosse leagues . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Even as box lacrosse grows in the United States , the American goalkeeper is a rarity . The skills required to be a successful field lacrosse goaltender and a successful box lacrosse goaltender are very different and do not lend well to one another . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Similar to fighting in ice hockey , fighting is tolerated in professional box lacrosse . Professional players are not automatically subject to ejection , but incur a five - minute major penalty . In Canadian Lacrosse Association play , players are assessed a five - minute major penalty plus a game misconduct . Fighting in youth or club level box lacrosse is typically penalized with expulsion and suspensions . In 1990 , when the Six Nations created the new Mohawk lacrosse league , fighting was specifically targeted as unacceptable . Violators were ejected from the game in which the altercation occurred and given a minimum three game suspension . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The first professional box lacrosse games were held in 1931 . That summer , the arena owners formed the International Lacrosse League , featuring four teams : the Montreal Canadiens , Montreal Maroons , Toronto Maple Leafs , and Cornwall Colts . The league lasted only two seasons . In the wake of the original International Lacrosse League opened the American Box Lacrosse League featuring six teams : two in New York City , and one each in Brooklyn , Toronto , Boston , and Baltimore . The league played to small crowds on outdoor fields such as Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park , before closing midway through its inaugural season . Lacrosse was officially declared Canada 's National Summer Sport with the passage of the National Sports Act ( Bill C - 212 ) on May 12 , 1994 . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) A player 's lacrosse stick must be between 40 inches ( 1.0 m ) and 46 inches ( 1.2 m ) in length ( youth levels may use shorter sticks ) . In most box lacrosse leagues , the use of a traditional wooden stick is allowed . However , almost no lacrosse players use wooden sticks anymore , preferring aluminum or another metal , and a plastic head . In the NLL , wooden lacrosse sticks are not allowed . Besides a lacrosse stick , each player must also wear a certain amount of protective equipment , including a lacrosse helmet with facemask , lacrosse gloves , arm and shoulder pads , and back / kidney pads . Rib pads are optional in some leagues . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) In some box leagues , especially the NLL , the five `` runners '' wear helmets specifically designed for box lacrosse . These helmets consist of a hockey helmet with a box lacrosse face mask attached instead of a hockey cage . \n",

      "\n",
      "2) In 2022 , Beijing will become the only city that has held both the summer and the winter Olympic Games . Nine cities will have hosted the Olympic Games more than once : Athens ( 1896 and 2004 Summer Olympics ) , Paris ( 1900 , 1924 and 2024 Summer Olympics ) , London ( 1908 , 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics ) , St. Moritz ( 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics ) , Lake Placid ( 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics ) , Los Angeles ( 1932 , 1984 and 2028 Summer Olympics ) , Innsbruck ( 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics ) , Tokyo ( 1964 and 2020 Summer Olympics ) and Beijing ( 2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics ) . In addition , Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics . London became the first city to have hosted three Games with the 2012 Summer Olympics . Paris will become the second city to do this with the 2024 Summer Olympics , followed by Los Angeles as the third in 2028 . The United States has hosted a total of eight Olympic Games , more than any other country , followed by France with five editions . Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , and the United Kingdom have each hosted three Games . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) This is a list of host cities of the Olympic Games , both summer and winter , since the modern Olympics began in 1896 . Since then , summer games have usually -- but not always -- celebrated a four - year period known as an Olympiad . There have been 28 Summer Olympic Games held in 24 cities , and 23 Winter Olympic Games held in 20 cities . In addition , three summer and two winter editions of the Games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war : Berlin ( summer ) in 1916 ; Tokyo / Helsinki ( summer ) and Sapporo / Garmisch - Partenkirchen ( winter ) in 1940 ; and London ( summer ) and Cortina d'Ampezzo , Italy ( winter ) in 1944 . The 1906 Summer Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens . However , in 1949 , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games . Four cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games : Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics , Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics , Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics , and Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Games have primarily been hosted in the continents of Europe ( 36 editions ) and North America ( 12 editions ) ; eight Games have been hosted in Asia and two have been hosted in Oceania . In 2016 , Rio de Janeiro became South America 's first Olympic host city , while the African continent has yet to hold the Games . Other major geographic regions which have never hosted the Olympics include the Middle East , the Indian subcontinent , the Caribbean , and Southeast Asia . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Host cities are selected by the IOC membership , usually seven years in advance . The selection process lasts approximately two years . In the first stage , any city in the world may submit an application to become a host city . After 10 months , the Executive Board of the IOC decides which applicant city will become official candidates as based on the recommendation of a working group that reviews the applications . In a second stage , the candidate cities are investigated thoroughly by an Evaluation Commission , which then submits a final short list of cities to be considered for selection . The host city is then chosen by vote of the IOC session , a general meeting of IOC members . \n",

      "1)Three seconds rule - Wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The three seconds rule ( also referred to as the three - second rule or three in the key , with often termed a lane violation ) requires that in basketball , a player shall not remain in the opponents ' restricted area for more than three consecutive seconds while their team is in control of a live ball in the frontcourt and the game clock is running . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The three - second rule was introduced in 1936 and was expressed as such : no offensive player with the ball could remain in the Key with or without the ball , for more than three seconds . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The three - second rule came about in part following a game at Madison Square Garden between the University of Kentucky ( UK ) and New York University ( NYU ) in 1935 , won by NYU 23 - 22 . The university of Kentucky team did not take their own referee , a common practice at the time , despite advice to the UK coach Adolph Rupp from Notre Dame coach George Keogan , who had lost to NYU the week prior and who warned Rupp of the discrepancies in officiating between the Midwest and the East . The game was rough . UK was unable to run its normal offense ( which consisted of using screens ) without being called for a foul . New York University 's Irving Terjesen and Irwin Klein combined to guard one of UK 's major players , Leroy Edwards , allowing him to score a mere 6 points ( the lowest output of his career ) . The New York Post reacted with alarm : `` The score says that NYU is the best college basketball team in the country and that the East still is supreme . But if Frank Lane , the referee from the Midwest , had worked the game , it 's safe to assume big Leroy Edwards would have been given a fantastic number of foul shots . Minor mayhem was committed on the person of Edwards by Terjesen and Klein . Something will have to be done or the game will become entirely too rough . '' \n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m− x is necessarily negative . </P> <P> In some contexts , different glyphs are used for these meanings ; for instance in the computer language APL and the expression language used by Texas Instruments graphing calculators ( definitely at least the early models including the TI - 81 and TI - 82 ) a raised minus sign is used in negative numbers ( as in 2\n",

      "1)Plus and minus signs - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Some elementary teachers use raised plus and minus signs before numbers to show they are positive or negative numbers . For example , subtracting − 5 from 3 might be read as `` positive three take away negative 5 '' and be shown as \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Though the signs now seem as familiar as the alphabet or the Hindu - Arabic numerals , they are not of great antiquity . The Egyptian hieroglyphic sign for addition , for example , resembled a pair of legs walking in the direction in which the text was written ( Egyptian could be written either from right to left or left to right ) , with the reverse sign indicating subtraction : \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The minus sign ( − ) has three main uses in mathematics : \n",
      "\n",
      "5) In the algebraic notation used to record games of chess , the plus sign ( + ) is used to denote a move that puts the opponent into check . A double plus ( + + ) is sometimes used to denote double check . Combinations of the plus and minus signs are used to evaluate a move ( + / − , + / = , = / + , − / + ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In most programming languages , subtraction and negation are indicated with the ASCII hyphen - minus character , - . In APL a raised minus sign ( Unicode U + 00AF ) is used to denote a negative number , as in _̄ 3 . While in J a negative number is denoted by an underscore , as in _5 . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In grading systems ( such as examination marks ) , the plus sign indicates a grade one level higher and the minus sign a grade lower . For example , B − ( `` B minus '' ) is one grade lower than B. Sometimes this is extended to two plus or minus signs ; for example A++ is two grades higher than A . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Plus and minus signs are often used in tree view on a computer screen to show if a folder is collapsed or not . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The hyphen - minus sign ( - ) is the ASCII alternative / version of the minus sign , and doubles as a hyphen . It is usually shorter in length than the plus sign and sometimes at a different height . It can be used as a substitute for the true minus sign when the character set is limited to ASCII . Most programming languages and other computer readable languages do this , since ASCII is generally available as a subset of most character encodings , while U + 2212 is a Unicode feature only . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) In C and some other computer programming languages , two plus signs indicate the increment operator and two minus signs a decrement . For example , x++ means `` increment the value of x by one '' and x -- means `` decrement the value of x by one '' . By extension , `` + + '' is sometimes used in computing terminology to signify an improvement , as in the name of the language C++ . \n",

      "\n",
      "2) `` Bob 's your uncle '' is an exclamation that is used when `` everything is all right '' and the simple means of obtaining the successful result is explained . For example : `` left over right ; right over left , and Bob 's your uncle -- a reef knot . '' Sometimes the phrase is followed with `` and Nellie 's your aunt '' or `` and Fanny 's your aunt . '' It is sometimes elaborately phrased Robert is your mother 's brother or similar for comic effect . \n",

      "3) ... And Bob 's your uncle is an expression of unknown origin , that means `` and there it is '' or `` and there you have it . '' It is commonly used in Great Britain and Commonwealth countries . Typically , someone says it to conclude a set of simple instructions or when a result is reached . The meaning is similar to that of the French expression `` et voilà ! '' \n",

      "5) A.J. Langguth and others have suggested that the expression arose after Conservative Prime Minister Robert `` Bob '' Cecil appointed his nephew Arthur Balfour as Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1887 , an act which was apparently both surprising and unpopular . Whatever other qualifications Balfour might have had , `` Bob 's your uncle '' was seen as the conclusive one . Regardless of the origin , the meaning has become acknowledging , announcing , or explaining a result or outcome that is achieved more easily than might be imagined . \n",

      "1) The episode began with Richard telling Monica that he 's never gotten over her and that he wants to marry and have children with her . Monica is left confused and when Chandler talks about how he hates marriage and ca n't see why anyone should get married she starts to feel unsure about their whole relationship . After Joey confirms to Monica that Chandler seemingly has no interest in getting married , Monica decides enough is enough and goes to meet Richard - she describes his apartment as `` a grown - up 's apartment '' and talks to him about the unfairness of the situation . Joey meanwhile tells Chandler how his plan has backfired on him and he is now in serious danger of losing Monica for good , and he leaves on a frantic search intending to propose when he finds her . After Monica leaves Richard 's apartment , Chandler comes and asks for Monica - he starts off by saying that Richard is a very bad man and he had his chances but he blew them . He also says that he and Monica are meant to be together and now Richard has blown Chandler 's chances , revealing he 'd intended to propose . Richard advises Chandler to go to Monica , warning that if he succeeds in winning her back , he must never let her go . \n",

      "\n",
      "3) After weeks of preparation , Chandler is ready to propose to Monica . While at a restaurant , Chandler begins his proposal however before he can ask the question Monica 's ex-boyfriend Richard ( Tom Selleck ) walks in and the moment is lost . When the others come home from the charity event , they constantly ask to see Monica 's hand , thinking Chandler proposed already . Feeling that Monica will figure out that Chandler plans to propose ( Chandler : `` Who walks into a room and asks to see a person 's hands ? ! '' ) , Joey suggests that Chandler pretend he does n't care about marriage and never wants to get married . Meanwhile , Richard approaches Monica at work and declares his love for her . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) After searching all day , Chandler hurries back to his apartment and when he gets there , Joey meets him in the hall , claiming Monica has left him because of his commitment issues . When Chandler enters their apartment , afraid of Monica actually leaving , he discovers that it 's far from being abandoned , there are candles lit all over and Monica is kneeling to propose . In the midst of proposing to Chandler , she cries from sheer emotion , saying , `` There 's a reason why girls do n't do this ! '' Instead , Chandler gets on his knees and proposes to her and Monica says yes . They then open the door to Joey , Rachel , and Phoebe , who have been waiting to celebrate . At first , they hesitate , feeling Ross should be there to share the moment , then decide that after three marriages , Ross can afford to miss one engagement celebration . End credits play while Monica and Chandler dance to Eric Clapton 's `` Wonderful Tonight . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Entertainment Weekly listed Chandler and Monica 's proposal scene in their `` 26 Great ' I Love You 's '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Sources suggest that David Schwimmer was actually out of the country filming Band of Brothers when the final scenes of the episode were filmed , hence why Ross is not there when the friends hug Monica and Chandler on hearing their announcement . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) `` The One with the Proposal '' is a double length episode of the television situation comedy Friends . It first aired on May 18 , 2000 , as the finale to the sixth season . It is normally transmitted as a whole episode in a one - hour slot , but when it is split for a half - hour slot the episodes are differentiated by having the title suffixed with Part One and Part Two . The episode was selected for Volume 4 of the `` Best of Friends '' DVD series , and when the series left the air in 2004 , several articles and viewer polls included this episode as one of the 10 best of the series ' 236 episodes . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Ross is being questioned by his friends about his relationship with Elizabeth ( Alexandra Holden ) ; mainly asking if the relationship is going anywhere . Ross quickly claims he and Elizabeth are great together , and his friends are all wrong ... until he sees her having a water balloon fight with her buddies . Deciding she is too young , he breaks off the relationship . Afterward , Ross questions his decision , until Elizabeth confirms her immaturity by dropping water balloons on his head from her upstairs window . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Rachel takes Phoebe and Joey to a charity event helping children , including a silent auction . While Phoebe is obviously over-drinking ( Phoebe : `` The more I drink , the less there is for the kids to drink ! '' ) , Joey has bigger problems ; misunderstanding the silent auction process , Joey thought that bidders guessed an item 's worth , with the prize going to the person with the closest guess . ( Rachel : Why would a charity give away a free boat ? Joey : I do n't know ... charity ? ) Joey `` guesses '' $20,000 and `` wins '' a yacht . Rachel and Joey try to convince the next highest bidder to buy the boat , but in the process of persuading the man of the boat 's virtues , Joey changes his mind and wants it for himself , although he can barely afford it . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The episode very nearly served as the series finale , given that NBC and Warner Bros. were in negotiations over the show 's future up until four days before the episode aired . The series ' stars demanded $750,000 salary for each actor per episode and agreed to a contract for two additional seasons , an agreement that later stretched into a further two seasons at $1 million salary for each of the stars . \n",

      "2) Dance Academy week was split among two episodes . The June 20 episode covered the first day of the Academy . The first task for the 10 all - stars was to watch solo dances by each of the competitors who were sent through from the auditions . From these , each all - star selected five dancers ( at least three from their own dance style ) , from the large number of auditioners , to join their `` team '' . If a dancer was selected by more than one all - star , he or she could choose which all - star 's team to join . Choreographer Warren Carlyle and the all - stars then taught the 50 remaining competitors a Broadway couples dance routine in 90 minutes , and dancers from each team were paired with dancers from another team . After all of the couples danced , each all - star was required to cut one dancer from his or her team , leaving a total of 40 contestants . Throughout the episode , Maddie Ziegler and Cat Deeley interviewed successful competitors . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The episode began with a group dance for all the contestants and all - stars that began with the Top 4 contestants waking up and getting ready for the big day . There were also new group dances for the hip - hop finalists and their all - stars ; the ballroom finalists and their all - stars ; and the contemporary finalists ( plus Emma ) and their all stars . In addition , there was a new group routine for all the finalists plus Maddie Ziegler , and Cat Deely chose to reprise her favorite all - stars routine . During the course of the broadcast , each of the Top 4 reprised their favorite solo of the season , each judge chose two favorite routines to see again , each of the all - stars chose a favorite duet to reprise , and other duets were reprised as described below . Results were announced during the last hour of the show as follows : Emma placed 4th , Tate was 3rd , J.T. was runner - up , and Kida won the $250,000 top prize and will be featured on the cover of Dance Spirit magazine . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The June 27 episode covered days two and three of Academy week . On day two , the all - stars each narrowed down their teams to three and then two dancers , based first on a hip - hop routine for pairs choreographed by Tabitha and Napoleon D'umo , and then on a contemporary routine , created by Travis Wall , danced simultaneously by the remaining three members of each team . On the last day , the last two dancers from each team danced a solo just for their own all - star . Each all - star then selected one finalist , making a total of 10 finalists that he or she will mentor through the finals round . The all - stars and their finalists are : \n",

The first live show , on July 11 , 2016 , opened with a group dance by all ten contestants dancing with their all - stars and all together , futuristically dressed in white . In the middle of the show there was a contemporary group dance by the all - stars , and the show ended with a group hip - hop dance by all of the top - ten contestants . During the show , each contestant performed one solo and one duet with his or her all - star ; both dances were in the contestant 's primary dance style . At the beginning of the show , host Cat Deeley announced that all - star Joshua Allen has been replaced by Marko Germar , to mentor and partner with hip - hop dancer Sheaden Gabriel . Maddie Ziegler observed the contestants ' rehearsals and joined the judging panel , during the broadcast , giving the contestants `` relatable feedback '' and offering encouraging words about their performances . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The final four competed on Labor Day . Audience voting after this show was combined with the votes from the August 29 show to determine the results of the season , so there was no elimination this week . The show again opened with a group number for the remaining contestants and the all - stars . The four contestants danced another routine , and later so did the all - stars . Each contestant performed a duet with an all - star who was not his or her mentor , in a new genre , and each also danced a solo in his or her own genre . Finally , the contestants each reprised their favorite routine of the season with their usual all - stars . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) So You Think You Can Dance : The Next Generation is the 13th season of So You Think You Can Dance , an American dance competition show . The show premiered on Monday , May 30 , 2016 in a new format featuring dancers between ages 8 to 13 at the time of their auditions . The season was broadcast on Fox in the United States , one show each week on Mondays , as it was the previous season . The top prize remained $250,000 , and Cat Deeley continued as host . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Season 13 featured a significant shift in format in that the contestants were all between the ages of 8 and 13 at the time of their auditions . Approximately 100 dancers were selected from the auditions for the next segment of the season , the Dance Academy . From these , the top 50 were chosen , and finally the top 10 were selected as finalists by a So You Think You Can Dance `` all - star '' who provided mentorship during the live shows and participated as a duet partner with his or her contestant in performances . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Derulo was unavailable this week , but all - star Stephen `` tWitch '' Boss took his place at the judging table ; Ziegler continued to attend and comment at the contestants ' rehearsals . The show opened with a group Bollywood - style number danced by all of the contestants and all - stars . In the middle of the show , the all - stars performed a piece inspired by Romeo and Juliet . Contestants were paired with each other to dance two routines ; each dancer performed at least one routine outside of his or her primary style . The kids also performed duets with their all - stars . Daniela and her partner Sheaden were ranked in the bottom two , based on the previous week 's voting , and Daniela was eliminated . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The show began with a group routine for all of the contestants and all - stars . Each of the contestants then danced with his or her all - star in their primary style . Two groups of all - stars danced separately : first a contemporary routine and then a Broadway number . In the second half of the show , the contestants each choreographed a duet with his or her all - star in their own genre , choosing the concept , music , costumes and make - up . Finally , judge Maddie Ziegler performed a dramatic contemporary routine paired with choreographer Travis Wall . Tahani was eliminated based on the previous week 's voting . \n",

      "2) On August 27 , 2012 , Vera Farmiga was the first to be cast in the leading role of Norma Louise Bates . On September 14 , 2012 , Freddie Highmore was cast as Norman Bates . That same day , Max Thieriot was cast as Norman 's half - brother , Dylan Massett . Shortly after , on September 19 , 2012 , Nicola Peltz was cast as Bradley Martin , a possible love interest for Norman . Finally , on September 20 , 2012 , Olivia Cooke was the final main cast member to join the series , in the role of Emma Decody , Norman 's best friend . Nestor Carbonell was cast in a recurring role as Sheriff Alex Romero in the first season , but was upgraded to the main cast at the beginning of the second season . In July 2014 , Kenny Johnson , who recurred as Norma 's brother Caleb Calhoun in the second season , was promoted to a series regular for the third season . It was announced on July 22 , 2016 at San Diego Comic - Con International that Rihanna would appear in the iconic role of Marion Crane for the fifth and final season . \n",

      "3) The series , a contemporary prequel to Alfred Hitchcock 's 1960 film Psycho ; based on Robert Bloch 's 1959 novel of the same name , depicts the lives of Norman Bates ( Freddie Highmore ) and his mother Norma ( Vera Farmiga ) prior to the events portrayed in the novel and film , albeit in a different fictional town ( White Pine Bay , Oregon , as opposed to Fairvale , California ) and in a modern - day setting . However , the final season loosely adapts the plot of Psycho . Max Thieriot and Olivia Cooke both starred as part of the main cast throughout the series ' run . After recurring in the first season , Nestor Carbonell was added to the main cast from season two onward . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The fourth season follows Norma as she becomes increasingly fearful of Norman , going to great lengths to find him the professional help he needs . This complicates their once unbreakable trust as Norman struggles to maintain his grip on reality . Meanwhile , Sheriff Romero once again finds himself drawn into Norma and Norman 's lives . He agrees to marry Norma because his insurance will enable her to place Norman in an expensive psychiatric hospital . His generosity backfires , however , when Norman learns of the marriage . Norman bitterly resents Romero for coming between him and his mother and at one point threatens the sheriff with an axe . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) A&E chose to skip a pilot of the series , opting to go straight - to - series by ordering a 10 - episode first season . On June 15 , 2015 , the series was renewed for a fourth and fifth season , making Bates Motel A&E 's longest - running original scripted drama series in the channel 's history . The series ' lead actors , Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore , received particular praise for their performances in the series , with the former receiving a Primetime Emmy Award nomination and winning a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television . Bates Motel also won three People 's Choice Awards for Favorite Cable TV Drama , and for Favorite Cable TV Actress ( Farmiga ) and Actor ( Highmore ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The fifth season begins two years after the death of Norma . Publicly happy and well - adjusted , Norman struggles at home , where his blackouts are increasing and `` Mother '' threatens to take him over completely . Meanwhile , Dylan and Emma find themselves drawn back into Norman 's world , and Romero hungers for revenge against his stepson , Norman . \n",

      "7) The first season follows Norma and Norman Bates as they buy a motel after Norman 's father dies . On one of the first nights of the two owning the motel , the former owner breaks in and sexually assaults Norma . Norman knocks the attacker out , and Norma stabs him to death . She decides it 's best not to call the police and to cover up the murder . She and Norman dispose of the body . He complicates the cover - up by keeping a belt that belonged to the victim . When the town sheriff and his deputy notice that a man has gone missing , Norma and Norman must keep them from digging too far . \n",

      "8) A replica of the original Bates Motel set from the film Psycho was built on location at approximately 1054 272nd Street in Aldergrove , British Columbia , where portions of the series were filmed . The original house and motel is located in Universal Studios , Hollywood , Los Angeles . Additional filming for the series took place in multiple areas in British Columbia , including Steveston , Coquitlam , Horseshoe Bay , West Vancouver and Fort Langley . In February 2017 , after filming was completed for the series , the Bates Motel exterior set in Aldergrove was demolished . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The third season focuses on Norman 's waning deniability about what 's happening to him , and the lengths he will go to gain control of his fragile psyche . The dramatic events of last season leave Norma more aware of her son 's mental fragility and fearful of what he is capable of . Meanwhile , Sheriff Romero begins to distance himself from the Bates family after he suspects Norma is lying to him about her husband 's death . \n",

The exact date is stated within the poem as being the ninth day of the month of Chaitra , which is the birthday of Rama , Rama Navami . Ramcharitmanas was composed at Ayodhya , Varanasi & Chitrakoot . India was under the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar ( 1556 - 1605 CE ) during this period .

Shiva ends his narration of the Rama Katha to Parvati as does Kakbhushundi to Garuda . It is not mentioned whether Yajnavalkya finishes his recitation to Bharadwaj .

      "9) Tulsidas begins the story with an invocation to various deities , his guru , and saints who have preceded him and those who will succeed him in the future . Homage is paid to Valmiki for bringing the Ramayana to the devotees of Rama . Next are introduced and praised the various characters of the epic beginning with the birthplace of Rama , the holy city of Ayodhya . Praises are bestowed on Dasharatha , the king of Ayodhya and Rama 's father , and his queens Kausalya , Kaikeyi and Sumitra . Tulsidas then praises King Janaka , the father - in - law of Rama ) , and his family . He goes on to praise the brothers of Rama - Bharata , Lakshman & Shatrughna and sings the glories of Hanuman , the constant companion to Rama , Sugriva , the monkey king and Jambavan , the leader of bears . Next , the characters of Sita and Rama are introduced . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The residents of Ayodhya ca n't spare the thought of being away from Rama and decide to join him in the forest . Rama , Sita , Lakshman and Sumantra go incognito and in the dead of the night leave the city and move into the forest . They leave for a place called Sringaverapur after which they meet Guha , the Nishad king . They arrive at Prayag , the holy city where the Rivers Ganges , Yamuna and Saraswati meet . Rama meets with the Sage Bharadwaj at his ashram . Rama is overwhelmed with the reception and love shown by the people inhabiting the banks of the Yamuna . Rama then meets Sage Valmiki , the author of the Ramayan at Chitrakoot dham . Valmiki recognises the true opulence of Rama and sings His praises . At this point Tulsidas takes great care to describe the beauty of the land of Chitrakoot with some inspiring poetry . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0mcolonial periods , as well as during the Commonwealth era . During the Japanese occupation the Philippines remained LHT , also because LHT had been required by the Japanese ; but during the Battle of Manila the liberating American forces drove their tanks to the right for easier facilitation of movement . RHT was formally finalised by Executive Order No. 34 signed by President Sergio Osmeña on\n",

      "\n",
      "4)Left - and right - hand traffic - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Historically there was less consistency in the relationship of the position of the driver to the handedness of traffic . Most American cars produced before 1910 were RHD . In 1908 Henry Ford standardised the Model T as LHD in RHT America , arguing that with RHD and RHT , the passenger was obliged to `` get out on the street side and walk around the car '' and that with steering from the left , the driver `` is able to see even the wheels of the other car and easily avoids danger . '' By 1915 other manufacturers followed Ford 's lead , due to the popularity of the Model T . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In RHT jurisdictions , vehicles are configured with LHD , with the driver sitting on the left side . In LHT jurisdictions , the reverse is true . The driver 's side , the side closest to the centre of the road , is sometimes called the offside , while the passenger side , the side closest to the side of the road , is sometimes called the nearside . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Sweden was LHT from about 1734 to 1967 , despite having land borders with RHT countries , and approximately 90 percent of cars being left - hand drive ( LHD ) vehicles . A referendum was held in 1955 , with an overwhelming majority voting against a change to RHT . Nevertheless , some years later the government ordered a conversion , which took place at 5 am on Sunday , 3 September 1967 . The accident rate dropped sharply after the change , but soon rose back to near its original level . The day was known as Dagen H ( `` H - Day '' ) , the ' H ' being for Högertrafik ( `` right traffic '' ) . When Iceland switched the following year , it was known as H - dagurinn , again meaning `` H - Day '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Many of the countries with LHT are former British colonies in the Caribbean , Southern Africa , Southeast Asia , South Asia , Australia , and New Zealand . Japan , Thailand , Nepal , Bhutan , Mozambique , Suriname , East Timor , and Indonesia are among those LHT countries outside the former British Empire . In Europe , only four countries still drive on the left : the United Kingdom , Ireland , Malta , and Cyprus , all of which are on islands that have no direct road connections with countries driving on the right . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Within the European Union , vehicles must be equipped with one or two rear - facing red rear fog lamps . A single rear fog lamp must be located between the vehicle 's longitudinal centreline and the outer extent of the driver 's side of the vehicle . When importing a vehicle to a country which drives on the opposite side of the road , this sometimes requires the purchase and installation of local - market lighting components . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The first keep - right law for driving in the United States was passed in 1792 and applied to the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike . New York formalized RHT in 1804 , New Jersey in 1813 and Massachusetts in 1821 . \n",

      "2) Into the Badlands is an American television series that premiered on AMC November 15 , 2015 . Based on the 16th - century novel by Chinese author Wu Cheng ' En , Journey to the West , the series features a story about a warrior and a young boy who journey through a dangerous feudal land together seeking enlightenment . AMC renewed the show for a 10 - episode second season , which premiered on March 19 , 2017 . On April 25 , 2017 , AMC renewed the series for a 16 - episode third season , which premiered on April 22 , 2018 . \n",

      "7) Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter gave a generally positive review and wrote , `` AMC finds a bloody , fun and entertaining non-zombie counterpart to The Walking Dead and turns Sundays into an escapist red zone . '' Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote , `` The action scenes scattered throughout Into the Badlands are not just stirringly presented , they represent a test passed with flying , and bloody , colors . This efficient AMC series is an homage to classic Samurai films and kinetic action fare churned out by Hong Kong maestros of furious fists , and if the TV drama had failed to meet the standards set by the sturdiest examples of those genres , it would have seemed superfluous at best . Fortunately , star Daniel Wu is more than up to the task of occupying the center of this streamlined story of vengeance , tyranny and roundhouse kicks . '' \n",

      "\n",
      "2) Slartibartfast is a character in The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , a comedy / science fiction series created by Douglas Adams . The character appears in the first and third novels , the first and third radio series ( and the LP adaptation of the first radio series ) , the 1981 television series and the 2005 feature film . The character was modelled after actor John Le Mesurier . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Douglas Adams writes in the notes accompanying the published volume of original radio scripts that he wanted Slartibartfast 's name to sound very rude , but still actually be broadcastable . He therefore started with the name `` Phartiphukborlz '' , and changed bits of it until it would be acceptable to the BBC . He came closer to achieving this goal in the following episode , with the double - act Lunkwill and Fook . He adds to this statement in Do n't Panic : The Official Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy Companion , an analysis by Neil Gaiman : \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Slartibartfast is a Magrathean , and a designer of planets . His favourite part of the job is creating coastlines , the most notable of which are the fjords found on the coast of Norway on planet Earth , for which he won an award . While trapped on prehistoric Earth , Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect see Slartibartfast 's signature deep inside a glacier in ancient Norway . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) In Life , the Universe and Everything Slartibartfast has joined the Campaign for Real Time ( or `` CamTim '' as the volunteers casually refer to it , a reference to CAMRA ) which tries to preserve events as they happened before time travelling was invented . He picks up Arthur and Ford from Lord 's Cricket Ground with his Starship Bistromath , after which they head out to stop the robots of Krikkit from bringing together the pieces of the Wikkit Gate . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Slartibartfast was first portrayed in the 1978 radio serial , in which he was voiced by Richard Vernon , who also portrayed him in the 1981 live - action miniseries . Richard Griffiths voiced him in the 2004 radio series . He was portrayed by Bill Nighy in the 2005 film adaptation of the first novel . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In any event , the new Earth is not required and , much to Slartibartfast 's disgust , its owners suggested that he take a quick skiing holiday on his glaciers before dismantling them . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) When Earth Mk. II is being made , Slartibartfast is assigned to the continent of Africa . He is unhappy about this because he has begun `` doing it with fjords again '' ( arguing that they give a continent a lovely baroque feel ) , but has been told by his superiors that they are `` not equatorial enough '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) ... One thing I do n't think I explained in the script book was that I was also teasing the typist , Geoffrey ( Perkins ) 's secretary , because ... she 'd be typing out this long and extraordinary name which would be quite an effort to type and right at the beginning he says ' My name is not important , and I 'm not going to tell you what it is ' .

      "\n",
      "2) Rostrally to the spinal cord lies the brain . The brain makes up the largest portion of the central nervous system , and is often the main structure referred to when speaking of the nervous system . The brain is the major functional unit of the central nervous system . While the spinal cord has certain processing ability such as that of spinal locomotion and can process reflexes , the brain is the major processing unit of the nervous system . \n",

      "4) Planarians , members of the phylum Platyhelminthes ( flatworms ) , have the simplest , clearly defined delineation of a nervous system into a central nervous system ( CNS ) and a peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . Their primitive brains , consisting of two fused anterior ganglia , and longitudinal nerve cords form the CNS ; the laterally projecting nerves form the PNS . A molecular study found that more than 95 % of the 116 genes involved in the nervous system of planarians , which includes genes related to the CNS , also exist in humans . Like planarians , vertebrates have a distinct CNS and PNS , though more complex than those of planarians . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The central nervous system ( CNS ) is the part of the nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord . The central nervous system is so named because it integrates information it receives from , and coordinates and influences the activity of , all parts of the bodies of bilaterally symmetric animals -- that is , all multicellular animals except sponges and radially symmetric animals such as jellyfish -- and it contains the majority of the nervous system . Many consider the retina and the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , as well as the olfactory nerves ( cranial nerve I ) and olfactory epithelium as parts of the CNS , synapsing directly on brain tissue without intermediate ganglia . As such , the olfactory epithelium is the only central nervous tissue in direct contact with the environment , which opens up for therapeutic treatments . The CNS is contained within the dorsal body cavity , with the brain housed in the cranial cavity and the spinal cord in the spinal canal . In vertebrates , the brain is protected by the skull , while the spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae . The brain and spinal cord are both enclosed in the meninges . In central nervous systems , the interneuronal space is filled with a large amount of supporting non-nervous cells called neuroglial cells . \n",

      "7) The cerebrum of cerebral hemispheres make up the largest visual portion of the human brain . Various structures combine to form the cerebral hemispheres , among others : the cortex , basal ganglia , amygdala and hippocampus . The hemispheres together control a large portion of the functions of the human brain such as emotion , memory , perception and motor functions . Apart from this the cerebral hemispheres stand for the cognitive capabilities of the brain . \n",

      "\n",
      "9) Microscopically , there are differences between the neurons and tissue of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system . The central nervous system is divided in white and gray matter . This can also be seen macroscopically on brain tissue . The white matter consists of axons and oligodendrocytes , while the gray matter consists of neurons and unmyelinated fibers . Both tissues include a number of glial cells ( although the white matter contains more ) , which are often referred to as supporting cells of the central nervous system . Different forms of glial cells have different functions , some acting almost as scaffolding for neuroblasts to climb during neurogenesis such as bergmann glia , while others such as microglia are a specialized form of macrophage , involved in the immune system of the brain as well as the clearance of various metabolites from the brain tissue . Astrocytes may be involved with both clearance of metabolites as well as transport of fuel and various beneficial substances to neurons from the capillaries of the brain . Upon CNS injury astrocytes will proliferate , causing gliosis , a form of neuronal scar tissue , lacking in functional neurons . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) From and to the spinal cord are projections of the peripheral nervous system in the form of spinal nerves ( sometimes segmental nerves ) . The nerves connect the spinal cord to skin , joints , muscles etc. and allow for the transmission of efferent motor as well as afferent sensory signals and stimuli . This allows for voluntary and involuntary motions of muscles , as well as the perception of senses . All in all 31 spinal nerves project from the brain stem , some forming plexa as they branch out , such as the brachial plexa , sacral plexa etc . Each spinal nerve will carry both sensory and motor signals , but the nerves synapse at different regions of the spinal cord , either from the periphery to sensory relay neurons that relay the information to the CNS or from the CNS to motor neurons , which relay the information out . \n",

      "1)The Price Is Right ( U.S. game show ) - Wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The Price Is Right is an American television game show created by Bob Stewart , Mark Goodson and Bill Todman . The show revolves around contestants competing to identify accurate pricing of merchandise to win cash and prizes . Contestants are selected from the studio audience when the announcer proclaims the show 's famous catchphrase , `` Come on down ! '' \n",
      "\n",
      "3) At the beginning of the show , four contestants are called from the audience by the announcer to take a spot on the front row behind bidding podiums , which are embedded into the front edge of the stage . This area is known as `` Contestants ' Row '' . The announcer shouts `` Come on down ! '' after calling each selected contestant 's name , a phrase which has become a trademark of the show . The four contestants in Contestants ' Row compete in a bidding round to determine which contestant will play the next pricing game ( the round is known as `` One Bid , '' which gets its name and format from one of two types of bidding rounds that existed on the 1950s version of the show ) . A prize is shown and each contestant gives a single bid for the item . In the first One - Bid game of each episode , bidding begins with the contestant on the viewer 's left - to - right . In subsequent One - Bid rounds , the order of bidding still moves from the viewer 's left - to - right , but it begins with the contestant most recently called down . Contestants are instructed to bid in whole dollars since the retail price of the item is rounded to the nearest dollar and another contestant 's bid can not be duplicated . If a contestant thinks the others have overbid , he or she bids $1 on the item . The contestant whose bid is closest to the actual retail price of the prize without going over wins that prize and gets to play the subsequent pricing game . If all four contestants overbid , short buzzer tones sound , the lowest bid is announced and the bids are erased . The host then instructs the contestants to re-bid below the lowest previous bid . If a contestant bids the actual retail price , a bell rings and the contestant wins a cash bonus in addition to the prize . From the introduction of the bonus in 1977 until 1998 , the `` perfect bid '' bonus was $100 ; it was permanently increased to the current $500 in 1998 . On The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular , the bonus was $1,000 . After each pricing game , another contestant is called to `` come on down '' to fill the spot of the contestant that won the previous round . The newest contestant bids first in each One Bid round . Contestants who fail to win a One Bid round -- thus never making it onstage to play a pricing game -- receive consolation prizes , currently $300 , often sponsored by companies revealed by the announcer near the end of the show , before the Showcase . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) On May 31 , 2006 , The Price Is Right was featured on the series Gameshow Marathon , one of seven classic game shows hosted by talk show host and actress Ricki Lake . This version combined aspects of the Barker and Davidson versions with the celebrity contestants playing three pricing games , followed by a Showcase Showdown where the two contestants with the highest scores moved on to the Showcase . The winner of the Showcase also earned a spot in Finalists ' Row . This version was announced by Fields and taped in Studio 46 . It also marked the first Price Is Right episode directed by DiPirro , who replaced Eskander as the director on the daytime show in January 2009 . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Three syndicated versions of The Price Is Right have aired . The first two followed the same format as the half - hour daytime version but were intended to air on most stations in the early evening in the pre-prime time slot , and as such they were referred by the announcer as `` the nighttime Price Is Right . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "6) At the end of the episode , the two contestants with the highest winnings , or since 1975 on hour - long episodes , the two Showcase Showdown winners , advance to the Showcase . A `` showcase '' of prizes ( currently two or three prizes ) is presented and the top winner has the option of placing a bid on the total value of the showcase or passing the showcase to the runner - up , who is then required to bid . A second showcase is then presented and the contestant who had not bid on the first showcase makes his or her bid . Unlike the One Bid , the contestant bidding on the second showcase may bid the same amount as their opponent on the first showcase , since the two contestants are bidding on different prize packages . The contestant who has bid nearer to the price of their own showcase without going over wins the prizes in his or her showcase . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The Price Is Right has aired over 8,000 episodes since its debut and is one of the longest - running network series in United States television history . In a 2007 article , TV Guide named The Price Is Right the `` greatest game show of all time . '' The show 's 46th season premiered on September 18 , 2017 . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Bob Barker began hosting The Price Is Right on September 4 , 1972 and completed a 35 - year tenure on June 15 , 2007 . Barker was hired as host while still hosting the stunt comedy show Truth or Consequences . His retirement coincided with his 50th year as a television host . His final show aired on June 15 , 2007 and was repeated in primetime , leading into the network 's coverage of the 34th Daytime Emmy Awards . In addition to hosting , Barker became Executive Producer of the show in March 1988 when Frank Wayne died and continued as such until his retirement , gaining significant creative control over the series between 2000 and his 2007 retirement . He also was responsible for creating several of the show 's pricing games , as well as launching The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular primetime spin - off . Reruns of Barker 's final season were aired throughout the summer from the Monday after his final show ( June 18 , 2007 ) until the Friday before Drew Carey 's debut as host ( October 12 , 2007 ) , when the season 35 finale was re-aired . During his time as host , Barker missed only one taping of four episodes ; Dennis James , then hosting the syndicated nighttime version of the show , filled in for him on these shows in December 1974 . After he became a noted animal rights advocate in 1981 shortly after the death of his wife Dorothy Jo , Barker signed off each broadcast , informing viewers with the public service message , `` Help control the pet population : have your pets spayed or neutered . '' Carey continued the tradition upon becoming the new host . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Road to Price is a six episode reality documentary show aired on the now - defunct CBS Innertube from September 20 to 27 in 2006 . The program featured nine teenage boys driving to Los Angeles in a refurbished mini-school bus as they leave their hometown of Merrimack , New Hampshire in order to be on The Price is Right . The episode of The Price is Right featuring the cast aired September 27 , 2006 . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The game show production team of Mark Goodson and Bill Todman was responsible for producing the original as well as the revival versions of the game show . Goodson - Todman staffer Bob Stewart is credited with creating the original version of The Price Is Right . Roger Dobkowitz was the producer from 1984 to 2008 , having worked with the program as a production staffer since the show 's debut after graduating from San Francisco State University . Occasionally , Dobkowitz appeared on - camera when answering a question posed by the host , usually relating to the show 's history or records . When he left the show at the end of season 36 , Variety reported that it was unclear whether he was retiring or was fired , although Carey indicated in a later interview with Esquire that Dobkowitz was fired . As of 2011 , the show uses multiple producers , all long - time staffers . Adam Sandler ( not to be confused with the actor ) is the producer of the show . Stan Blits , who joined the show in 1980 and Sue MacIntyre are the co-producers . Kathy Greco joined the show in 1975 and became producer in 2008 ; she announced her retirement October 8 , 2010 on the show 's website , effective at the end of the December 2010 tapings . Her last episode as producer , which aired January 27 , 2011 , featured a theme in tribute to her . The show 's official website featured a series of videos including an interview with Greco as a tribute to her 35 years in the days leading up to her final episode . Frank Wayne , a Goodson - Todman staffer since the 1950s , was the original executive producer of the CBS version of the show . Barker assumed that role after Wayne 's death in March 1988 , as previously stated . Previous producers have included Jay Wolpert , Barbara Hunter and Phil Wayne Rossi ( Wayne 's son ) . Michael Dimich assumed the director 's chair in June 2011 . Marc Breslow , Paul Alter , Bart Eskander and Rich DiPirro each served long stints previously as director . Former associate directors Andrew Felsher and Fred Witten , as well as technical director Glenn Koch , have directed episodes strictly on a fill - in basis . Sandler began directing episodes in 2012 , and became the official director in 2013 . Aside from Barker , the show 's production staff remained intact after Carey became host . FremantleMedia executive Syd Vinnedge was named the program 's new executive producer , with Richards becoming co-executive producer after Dobkowitz 's departure . Richards was a candidate to replace Barker as host in 2007 , before Carey was ultimately chosen . Richards succeeded Vinnedge as executive producer when the 2009 -- 10 season started , with Tracy Verna Soiseth joining Richards as co-executive producer in 2010 . Vinnedge remains credited as an executive consultant to the show . \n",

      "1)The bridge on the River Kwai - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The Bridge on the River Kwai is a 1957 British - American epic war film directed by David Lean and starring William Holden , Jack Hawkins , and Alec Guinness , and featuring Sessue Hayakawa . Based on the novel Le Pont de la Rivière Kwai ( 1952 ) by Pierre Boulle , the film is a work of fiction , but borrows the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942 -- 1943 for its historical setting . The movie was filmed in Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) . The bridge in the film was near Kitulgala . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The bridge described in the book did n't actually cross the River Kwai . Pierre Boulle had never been to the bridge . He knew that the ' death railway ' ran parallel to the River Kwae for many miles , and he therefore assumed that it was the Kwae which it crossed just north of Kanchanaburi . This was an incorrect assumption ; the bridge actually crossed the Mae Klong river . The destruction of the bridge as depicted in the film is also entirely fictional . In fact , two bridges were built : a temporary wooden bridge and a permanent steel / concrete bridge a few months later . Both bridges were used for two years , until they were destroyed by Allied bombing . The steel bridge was repaired and is still in use today . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Channel 4 held a poll in 2005 to find the 100 Greatest War Movies : The Bridge on the River Kwai came in at # 10 , behind Black Hawk Down and in front of The Dam Busters . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The British Film Institute placed The Bridge on the River Kwai as the eleventh greatest British film . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Ernest Gordon , a survivor of the POW camps and railway construction described in the movie , stated in his book Through the Valley of the Kwai recounting his experiences as a POW : `` In Pierre Boulle 's book The Bridge over the River Kwai and the film which was based on it , the impression was given that British officers not only took part in building the bridge willingly , but finished in record time to demonstrate to the enemy their superior efficiency . This was an entertaining story . But I am writing a factual account , and in justice to these men -- living and dead -- who worked on that bridge , I must make it clear that we never did so willingly . We worked at bayonet point and under bamboo lash , taking any risk to sabotage the operation whenever the opportunity arose . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In an interview that forms part of the 1969 BBC2 documentary `` Return to the River Kwai '' made by former POW John Coast , Boulle outlined the reasoning that led him to conceive the character of Nicholson . A transcript of the interview and the documentary as a whole can be found in the new edition of John Coast 's book Railroad of Death . Coast 's documentary sought to highlight the real history behind the film ( partly through getting ex-POWs to question its factual basis , for example Dr Hugh de Wardener and Lt - Col Alfred Knights ) , which angered many former POWs . The documentary itself was described by one newspaper reviewer when it was shown on Boxing Day 1974 ( The Bridge on the River Kwai had been shown on BBC1 on Christmas Day 1974 ) as `` Following the movie , this is a rerun of the antidote . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The largely fictional film plot is loosely based on the building in 1943 of one of the railway bridges over the Mae Klong -- renamed Khwae Yai in the 1960s -- at a place called Tha Ma Kham , five kilometres from the Thai town of Kanchanaburi . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The film was relatively faithful to the novel , with two major exceptions . Shears , who is a British commando officer like Warden in the novel , became an American sailor who escapes from the POW camp . Also , in the novel , the bridge is not destroyed : the train plummets into the river from a secondary charge placed by Warden , but Nicholson ( never realising `` what have I done ? '' ) does not fall onto the plunger , and the bridge suffers only minor damage . Boulle nonetheless enjoyed the film version though he disagreed with its climax . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The Japanese resented the implication in the movie that their engineers were less capable than British engineers . In fact , Japanese engineers had been surveying the route of the railway since 1937 and were highly organized . In essence , viewers disliked the `` glorification of the superiority of Western civilization '' represented in the movie , illustrated by the British being able to build a bridge that the Japanese could not . The film also contains a scene where Colonel Nicholson , while inspecting the bridge construction progress , refers to the Japanese overseeing them as `` barbarians '' . In the version of the movie edited for DVD in 2000 , the reference is overdubbed with a water splash sound . \n",

      "1) `` When You Say Nothing at All '' is a country song written by Paul Overstreet and Don Schlitz . It is among the best - known hit songs for three different performers : Keith Whitley , who took it to the top of the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart on December 24 , 1988 ; Alison Krauss , whose version was her first solo top - 10 country hit in 1995 ; and Irish pop singer Ronan Keating , whose version was his first solo single and a chart - topper in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1999 . \n",
      "\n",
      "2)When You Say Nothing at All - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "3) RCA released `` When You Say Nothing at All '' as the follow - up single to the title song of Whitley 's Do n't Close Your Eyes album . The former song already had hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart , his first chart - topper after three prior singles made the top 10 . `` When You Say Nothing at All '' entered the Hot Country Singles chart on September 17 , 1988 , at No. 61 , and gradually rose to the top , where it stayed for two weeks at the end of the year . It was the second of five consecutive chart - topping singles for Whitley , who did not live to see the last two , as he died on May 9 , 1989 of alcohol poisoning . `` Keith did a great job singin ' that song , '' co-composer Schlitz told author Tom Roland . `` He truly sang it from the heart . '' In 2004 , Whitley 's original was ranked 12th among CMT 's 100 Greatest Love Songs . It was sung by Sara Evans on the show . As of February 2015 , the song has sold 599,000 digital copies in the US after it became available for download . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) `` When You Say Nothing at All '' was released as the debut solo single by Irish singer - songwriter Ronan Keating . The song was recorded in 1999 for the soundtrack to the film Notting Hill and also appeared on Keating 's debut solo album , Ronan . The song was released on July 26 , 1999 , in the United Kingdom . It peaked at number one in the UK , Ireland , and New Zealand . In the UK , the single was certified gold . In 2003 , Keating re-recorded the song as a duet with Mexican singer Paulina Rubio , which was released in Mexico and Latin America ( excluding Brazil ) to promote Keating 's second studio album , Destination . In Brazil , Ronan chose the Brazilian singer Deborah Blando to re-record the song for the 10 Years Of Hits album exclusive for that country ( an exclusive music video was recorded for this version with Deborah ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Overstreet and Schlitz came up with `` When You Say Nothing at All '' at the end of an otherwise unproductive day . Strumming a guitar , trying to write their next song , they were coming up empty . `` As we tried to find another way to say nothing , we came up with the song , '' Overstreet later told author Ace Collins . They thought the song was OK , but nothing special . When Keith Whitley heard it , he loved it , and was not going to let it get away . Earlier , he had recorded another Overstreet - Schlitz composition that became a No. 1 hit for another artist - Randy Travis ' `` On the Other Hand . '' Whitley did not plan to let `` When You Say Nothing at All '' meet the same fate . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In 1995 , Alison Krauss covered the song with the group Union Station for a tribute album to Whitley titled Keith Whitley : A Tribute Album . The single release featured `` Charlotte 's in North Carolina , '' one of several previously - unreleased tracks sung by Whitley on the album , as the B - side . After Krauss 's cover began to receive unsolicited airplay , BNA Records , the label that had released the album , issued Krauss ' version to radio in January 1995 . That version , also featured on Krauss ' compilation Now That I 've Found You : A Collection , peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart , and a commercial single reached No. 2 on the same magazine 's Hot Country Singles Sales chart . The single 's B - side was a previously unreleased Whitley song titled `` Charlotte 's in North Carolina '' , which also appeared on the tribute album . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Krauss ' recording won the 1995 CMA award for `` Single of the Year '' . The song has been featured a couple of times in the soap opera The Young and the Restless . Krauss ' version was also used in the 1999 motion picture `` The Other Sister '' . The song has sold 468,000 digital downloads as of May 2017 . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) While Krauss ' version was on the charts , Mike Cromwell , then the production director at WMIL - FM in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , concocted a duet merging elements of Krauss ' version with Whitley 's original hit version . The `` duet '' garnered national attention , and it spread from at least Philadelphia to Albuquerque , and has been heard on radio stations in California as well . This `` duet '' was however never officially serviced to radio and has never been available commercially . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The Italian - Ukrainian - Brazilian singer Deborah Blando recorded `` When You Say Nothing at All '' in English and Portuguese for the Brazilian version of the song , which featured on the Brazilian version of Destination . The single reached the top 10 in the Latin charts . Burmese singer Zaw Paing also made a Burmese version cover . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Its success , as well as that of the album , caught Krauss by surprise . `` It 's a freak thing , '' she told a Los Angeles Times reporter in March 1995 . `` It 's kinda ticklin ' us all . We have n't had anything really chart before . At all . Is n't it funny though ? We do n't know what 's goin ' on ... The office said , ' Hey , it 's charting , ' and we 're like , ' Huh ? ' '' \n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1)Easy Rider - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Easy Rider is a 1969 American independent road drama film written by Peter Fonda , Dennis Hopper , and Terry Southern , produced by Fonda , and directed by Hopper . Fonda and Hopper played two bikers who travel through the American Southwest and South carrying the proceeds from a drug ( cocaine ) deal . The success of Easy Rider helped spark the New Hollywood era of filmmaking during the early 1970s . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Hopper and Fonda 's first collaboration was in The Trip ( 1967 ) , written by Jack Nicholson , which had themes and characters similar to those of Easy Rider . Peter Fonda had become `` an icon of the counterculture '' in The Wild Angels ( 1966 ) , where he established `` a persona he would develop further in The Trip and Easy Rider . '' The Trip also popularized LSD , while Easy Rider went on to `` celebrate 60s counterculture '' but does so `` stripped of its innocence . '' Author Katie Mills wrote that The Trip is a way point along the `` metamorphosis of the rebel road story from a Beat relic into its hippie reincarnation as Easy Rider '' , and connected Peter Fonda 's characters in those two films , along with his character in The Wild Angels , deviating from the `` formulaic biker '' persona and critiquing `` commodity - oriented filmmakers appropriating avant - garde film techniques . '' It was also a step in the transition from independent film into Hollywood 's mainstream , and while The Trip was criticized as a faux , popularized underground film made by Hollywood insiders , Easy Rider `` interrogates '' the attitude that underground film must `` remain strictly segregated from Hollywood . '' Mills also wrote that the famous acid trip scene in Easy Rider `` clearly derives from their first tentative explorations as filmmakers in The Trip . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Hopper was also said to be difficult on set . During test shooting on location in New Orleans , Hopper fought with the production 's ad hoc crew for control . At one point he entered into a physical confrontation with photographer Barry Feinstein , who was one of the camera operators for the shoot . After this turmoil , Hopper and Fonda decided to assemble a proper crew for the rest of the film . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Hopper and Fonda hosted a wrap party for the movie and then realized they had not yet shot the final campfire scene . Thus , it was shot after the bikes had already been stolen , which is why they are not visible in the background as in the other campfire scenes . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) According to Terry Southern 's biographer , Lee Hill , the part of George Hanson had been written for Southern 's friend , actor Rip Torn . When Torn met with Hopper and Fonda at a New York restaurant in early 1968 to discuss the role , Hopper began ranting about the `` rednecks '' he had encountered on his scouting trip to the South . Torn , a Texan , took exception to some of Hopper 's remarks , and the two almost came to blows , as a result of which Torn withdrew from the project . Torn was replaced by Jack Nicholson , whom Hopper had recently appeared with in Head ( along with another Easy Rider co-star , Toni Basil ) . In 1994 , Jay Leno interviewed Hopper about Easy Rider on The Tonight Show , and during the interview , Hopper alleged that Torn had pulled a knife on him during the altercation , prompting Torn to sue Hopper successfully for defamation . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In total , four former police bikes were used in the film . The 1949 , 1950 and 1952 Harley - Davidson Hydra - Glide bikes were purchased at an auction for $500 , equivalent to about $3500 in 2018 . Each bike had a backup to make sure that shooting could continue in case one of the old machines failed or got wrecked accidentally . One `` Captain America '' was demolished in the final scene , while the other three were stolen and probably taken apart before their significance as movie props became known . The demolished bike was rebuilt by Dan Haggerty and offered for auction on October 18 , 2014 by Profiles in History , a Calabasas , CA - based auction house with an estimated value of $1 million to $1.2 million . The provenance of existing Captain America motorcycles is unclear , and has been the subject of much litigation . A motorcycle on display at the EMP Museum in Seattle , Washington is identified by that organization as the original rebuilt movie prop . A replica resides at the National Motorcycle Museum in Anamosa , Iowa . Many other replicas have been built since the film 's release . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) When seeing a still of himself and Bruce Dern in The Wild Angels , Peter Fonda had the idea of a modern Western , involving two bikers travelling around the country and eventually getting shot by hillbillies . He called Dennis Hopper , and the two decided to turn that into a movie , The Loners , with Hopper directing , Fonda producing , and both starring and writing . They brought in screenwriter Terry Southern , who came up with the title Easy Rider . The film was mostly shot without a screenplay , with ad - libbed lines , and production started with only the outline and the names of the protagonists . Keeping the Western theme , Wyatt was named after Wyatt Earp and Billy after Billy the Kid . However , Southern disputed that Hopper wrote much of the script . In an interview published in 2016 ( Southern died in 1995 ) he said , `` You know if Den Hopper improvises a dozen lines and six of them survive the cutting room floor he 'll put in for screenplay credit . Now it would be almost impossible to exaggerate his contribution to the film -- but , by George , he manages to do it every time . '' According to Southern , Fonda was under contract to produce a motorcycle film with A.I.P. , which Fonda had agreed to allow Hopper to direct . According to Southern , Fonda and Hopper did n't seek screenplay credit until after the first screenings of the film , which required Southern 's agreement due to writers guild policies . Southern says he agreed out of a sense of camaraderie , and that Hopper later took credit for the entire script . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The motorcycles for the film , based on hardtail frames and panhead engines , were designed and built by two African - American chopper builders -- Cliff Vaughs and Ben Hardy -- following ideas of Peter Fonda , and handled by Tex Hall and Dan Haggerty during shooting . \n",

      "10) The filming budget of Easy Rider was $360,000 to $400,000 . Peter Fonda said that on top this , he personally paid for the costs of travel and lodging for the crew , saying , `` Everybody was taking my credit cards and would pay for all the hotels , the food , the gas , everything with Diner 's Club '' . Laszlo Kovacs said that an additional $1 million , `` about three times the budget for shooting the rest of the film '' was spent licensing music that was added during the editing . \n",

      "\n",
      "2) The transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 ended the colony 's ties to the Commonwealth through the United Kingdom . The government of Hong Kong , as a special administrative region of China , did not pursue membership . Hong Kong has nevertheless continued to participate in some of the organisations of the Commonwealth family , such as the Commonwealth Lawyers Association ( hosted the Commonwealth Lawyers Conference in 1983 and 2009 ) , the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association ( and the Westminster Seminar on Parliamentary Practice and Procedures ) , the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Besides the Commonwealth Games , other sporting competitions are organised on a Commonwealth basis , through championship tournaments such as the Commonwealth Taekwondo Championships , Commonwealth Fencing Championships , Commonwealth Judo Championships , Commonwealth Rowing Championships , Commonwealth Sailing Championships , Commonwealth Shooting Championships and Commonwealth Pool Lifesaving Championships . The Commonwealth Boxing Council has long maintained Commonwealth titles for the best boxers in the Commonwealth . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Commonwealth of Nations ( formerly the British Commonwealth ) , also known as simply the Commonwealth , is an intergovernmental organisation of 52 member states that are mostly former territories of the British Empire . The Commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of the member states , organised through the Commonwealth Secretariat and non-governmental organisations , organised through the Commonwealth Foundation . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The Commonwealth dates back to the mid-20th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self - governance of its territories . It was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949 , which established the member states as `` free and equal '' . The symbol of this free association is Queen Elizabeth II who is the Head of the Commonwealth , but this role does not carry any power with it . While there are over 31 republics and five monarchies who have a different monarch , the Queen is the ceremonial head of state and reigning constitutional monarch of 16 members of the Commonwealth , known as Commonwealth realms but retains a crown legally distinct from the other realms with the position as monarch being separate from that of Head of the Commonwealth . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Due to their shared constitutional histories , several countries in the Commonwealth have similar legal and political systems . The Commonwealth requires its members to be functioning democracies that respect human rights and the rule of law . Most Commonwealth countries have the bicameral Westminster system of parliamentary democracy . The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association facilitates co-operation between legislatures across the Commonwealth , and the Commonwealth Local Government Forum promotes good governance amongst local government officials . Most Commonwealth members use common law , modelled on English law . The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the supreme court of 14 Commonwealth members . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) After World War II ended , the British Empire was gradually dismantled . Most of its components have become independent countries , whether Commonwealth realms or republics , and members of the Commonwealth . There remain the 14 mainly self - governing British overseas territories which retain some political association with the United Kingdom . In April 1949 , following the London Declaration , the word `` British '' was dropped from the title of the Commonwealth to reflect its changing nature . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In recognition of their shared heritage and culture , Commonwealth countries are not considered to be `` foreign '' to each other , although the technical extent of this concept varies in different countries . For example , in Australia , for the purpose of considering certain constitutional and legal provisions no distinction is made between Commonwealth and foreign countries : in the High Court case of Sue v Hill , other Commonwealth countries were held to be foreign powers ; similarly , in Nolan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs , the nationals of other Commonwealth realms were held to be ' aliens ' . Nevertheless , the closer association amongst Commonwealth countries is reflected at least in the diplomatic protocols of the Commonwealth countries . For example , when engaging bilaterally with one another , Commonwealth governments exchange high commissioners instead of ambassadors . Between two Commonwealth realms , they represent the head of government rather than the head of state . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Other eligible applicants could be any of the remaining inhabited British overseas territories , Crown dependencies , Australian external territories and the Associated States of New Zealand if they become fully independent . Many such jurisdictions are already directly represented within the Commonwealth , particularly through the Commonwealth Family . There are also former British possessions that have not become independent , for example , Hong Kong , which still participates in some of the institutions within the Commonwealth Family . All three Crown dependencies regard the existing situation as unsatisfactory and have lobbied for change . The States of Jersey have called on the UK Foreign Secretary to request that the Commonwealth Heads of Government `` consider granting associate membership to Jersey and the other Crown Dependencies as well as any other territories at a similarly advanced stage of autonomy '' . Jersey has proposed that it be accorded `` self - representation in all Commonwealth meetings ; full participation in debates and procedures , with a right to speak where relevant and the opportunity to enter into discussions with those who are full members ; and no right to vote in the Ministerial or Heads of Government meetings , which is reserved for full members '' . The States of Guernsey and the Government of the Isle of Man have made calls of a similar nature for a more integrated relationship with the Commonwealth , including more direct representation and enhanced participation in Commonwealth organisations and meetings , including Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings . The Chief Minister of the Isle of Man has said : `` A closer connection with the Commonwealth itself would be a welcome further development of the Island 's international relationships '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Under the formula of the London Declaration , Queen Elizabeth II is the Head of the Commonwealth , a title that is by law a part of Elizabeth 's royal titles in each of the Commonwealth realms , the 16 members of the Commonwealth that recognise the Queen as their monarch . However , when the monarch dies , the successor to the crown does not automatically become Head of the Commonwealth . The position is symbolic , representing the free association of independent members , the majority of which ( 31 ) are republics , and five have monarchs of different royal houses ( Brunei , Lesotho , Malaysia , Swaziland , and Tonga ) . \n",

      "\n",
      "3)Pulse - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "4) In medicine , a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat by trained fingertips . The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body , such as at the neck ( carotid artery ) , wrist ( radial artery ) , at the groin ( femoral artery ) , behind the knee ( popliteal artery ) , near the ankle joint ( posterior tibial artery ) , and on foot ( dorsalis pedis artery ) . Pulse ( or the count of arterial pulse per minute ) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate . The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by auscultation , traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute . The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers . This has a reason : the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure , the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure , and the finger most distal to the heart ( usually the ring finger ) is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches ( superficial and deep ) . The study of the pulse is known as sphygmology . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The heart rate may be greater or lesser than the pulse rate depending upon physiologic demand . In this case , the heart rate is determined by auscultation or audible sounds at the heart apex , in which case it is not the pulse . The pulse deficit ( difference between heart beats and pulsations at the periphery ) is determined by simultaneous palpation at the radial artery and auscultation at the PMI , near the heart apex . It may be present in case of premature beats or atrial fibrillation . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) A normal pulse is regular in rhythm and force . An irregular pulse may be due to sinus arrhythmia , ectopic beats , atrial fibrillation , paroxysmal atrial tachycardia , atrial flutter , partial heart block etc . Intermittent dropping out of beats at pulse is called `` intermittent pulse '' . Examples of regular intermittent ( regularly irregular ) pulse include pulsus bigeminus , second - degree atrioventricular block . An example of irregular intermittent ( irregularly irregular ) pulse is atrial fibrillation . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) It corresponds to diastolic blood pressure . A low tension pulse ( pulsus mollis ) , the vessel is soft or impalpable between beats . In high tension pulse ( pulsus durus ) , vessels feel rigid even between pulse beats . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Claudius Galen was perhaps the first physiologist to describe the pulse . The pulse is an expedient tactile method of determination of systolic blood pressure to a trained observer . Diastolic blood pressure is non-palpable and unobservable by tactile methods , occurring between heartbeats . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) A form or contour of a pulse is palpatiory estimation of arteriogram . A quickly rising and quickly falling pulse ( pulsus celer ) is seen in aortic regurgitation . A slow rising and slowly falling pulse ( pulsus tardus ) is seen in aortic stenosis . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Although the pulse can be felt in multiple places in the head , people should not normally hear their heartbeats within the head . This is called pulsatile tinnitus , and it can indicate several medical disorders . \n",

      "3) The book tells the story of Burns ' imprisonment on a chain gang in Georgia in the 1920s , his subsequent escape , and the furor that developed . The story was first published in January 1932 , serialized in True Detective Mysteries magazine . Later that year , Burns ' story was made into the motion picture I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang , starring Paul Muni .

      "3) The Tacoma School District purchased the gutted building on February 19 , 1904 , with the intent of turning it into a high school . The redesign and later renovations were planned by the school 's architect , Frederick Heath . It was repaired and renovated into a school . Despite its extraordinary locale and design , on the inside it looks , feels , and operates like a typical American high school . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Stadium High School is a public high school in Tacoma , Washington , and a historic landmark . It is part of Tacoma Public Schools , or Tacoma School District No. 10 and is located in the Stadium District , near downtown Tacoma . The original building burned to a shell in 1898 while it was still a partially constructed hotel designed by Hewitt & Hewitt that was being used for storage . It was reconstructed for use as a school beginning in 1906 according to designs by Frederick Heath , and a `` bowl '' stadium was added later in 1910 . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The centennial celebration of Stadium High School was held on September 16 , 2006 . The celebration was attended by 3299 alumni , setting a Guinness World Record for the largest recorded school reunion . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In the years of 2006 and 2007 , no one in Tacoma submitted a float , a requirement for participation in the festival . The festival board waived the requirement , but in 2008 warned that if no group within Tacoma School District boundaries presented a float , Tacoma and its students , including the Royal Court program , would be barred from participation in the 2009 parade . In response , the Stadium High School Environmental Club decided to build a float , ensuring Stadium and other area schools inclusion in the Daffodil Festival for 2009 . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The reconstructed building opened on September 10 , 1906 , as Tacoma High School . Seven years later , the name was changed to reference the adjacent Stadium Bowl . Later additions included a circular lunchroom , an underground swimming pool , a science and industrial arts complex , a gymnasium , and a multi-story parking lot structure with tennis courts on the roof . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In 2005 - 2006 the school underwent a major renovation , seismic upgrade , historical restoration , and expansion . Bassetti Architects were the design architects , and Merrit Pardini Architects ( later Krei Architecture ) were the architects of record for this work . During the renovation , students were temporarily relocated to the old site of Mount Tahoma High School in the south end , just over 7 miles ( 11 km ) away . \n",

      "9) Annie Jeong of Stadium was crowned Daffodil queen 2010 . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The main building was constructed by architects Hewitt and Hewitt for the Northern Pacific Railroad Company and the Tacoma Land Company at what was then known as Blackwell Point . Construction began in 1891 with the intention of building a luxury hotel resembling a French château . The Panic of 1893 , however , brought construction to an abrupt halt when the Northern Pacific was faced with financial disaster . The unfinished building became a storage facility , with much of the building materials still inside . On October 11 , 1898 , the building was gutted by a massive fire . The walls remained standing , and the Northern Pacific began to dismantle the structure , removing some 40,000 bricks that would be used to construct still - existing train stations in Missoula , Montana , and Wallace , Idaho . \n",

      "2) The WWE Championship is a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship in WWE , currently on the SmackDown brand . It is the first world title established in WWE , having been introduced in 1963 as the World Wide Wrestling Federation ( WWWF ) World Heavyweight Championship . The promotion was renamed World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) in 1979 and ended its affiliation with the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) in 1983 , with the title also renamed to reflect the changes . In 2001 , it was unified with the World Championship ( formerly the WCW World Heavyweight Championship ) following the WWF 's buyout of World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) and became the Undisputed WWF Championship . In 2002 , the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) and split its roster into two brands , Raw and SmackDown . The title , now renamed WWE Championship , was then designated to the SmackDown brand while WWE established an alternate world title known as the World Heavyweight Championship for the Raw brand . A third alternate world title , the ECW World Heavyweight Championship , was reactivated for the ECW brand in 2006 . It was vacated and decommissioned when the ECW brand disbanded in 2010 . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) When WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena at the TLC pay - per - view on December 15 , 2013 , the World Heavyweight Championship was unified with the WWE Championship , resulting in the retiring of the former and the renaming of the latter to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship . On June 27 , 2016 , the name was shortened back to the WWE Championship before assuming the WWE World Championship name on July 26 , when the brand extension returned . It became designated to the SmackDown brand and WWE again established an alternate world title known as the WWE Universal Championship for the Raw brand . In December 2016 , WWE again shortened the title 's name back to WWE Championship . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The championship is generally contested in professional wrestling matches , in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition . Some reigns were held by champions using a ring name , while others use their real name . The first champion was Buddy Rogers , who won the championship in 1963 . The champion with the single longest reign is Bruno Sammartino with a reign of 2,803 days , while the record for longest combined reign is also held by Sammartino at 4,040 . The current champion is AJ Styles , who is in his second reign . He won the championship by defeating Jinder Mahal on SmackDown in Manchester , England on November 7 , 2017 . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Overall , there have been 50 different official champions , with John Cena having the most reigns at thirteen . Seven men in history have held the championship for a continuous reign of one year ( 365 days ) or more : Bruno Sammartino ( who achieved the feat on two separate occasions ) , Pedro Morales , Bob Backlund , Hulk Hogan , Randy Savage , John Cena , and CM Punk . \n",

      "1)Falklands War - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The Falklands War ( Spanish : Guerra de las Malvinas ) , also known as the Falklands Conflict , Falklands Crisis , Malvinas War , South Atlantic Conflict , and the Guerra del Atlántico Sur ( Spanish for `` South Atlantic War '' ) , was a ten - week war between Argentina and the United Kingdom over two British dependent territories in the South Atlantic : the Falkland Islands , and its territorial dependency , the South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . It began on Friday , 2 April 1982 , when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands ( and , the following day , South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands ) in an attempt to establish the sovereignty it had claimed over them . On 5 April , the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands . The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with the Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982 , returning the islands to British control . In total , 649 Argentine military personnel , 255 British military personnel , and three Falkland Islanders died during the hostilities . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Chile gave support to the UK in the form of intelligence about the Argentine military and early warning intelligence on Argentine air movements . Throughout the war , Argentina was afraid of a Chilean military intervention in Patagonia and kept some of its best mountain regiments away from the Falklands near the Chilean border as a precaution . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The ongoing tension between the two countries over the islands increased on 19 March when a group of Argentine scrap metal merchants ( actually infiltrated by Argentine marines ) raised the Argentine flag at South Georgia Island , an act that would later be seen as the first offensive action in the war . The Royal Navy ice patrol vessel HMS Endurance was dispatched from Stanley to South Georgia on the 25th in response . The Argentine military junta , suspecting that the UK would reinforce its South Atlantic Forces , ordered the invasion of the Falkland Islands to be brought forward to 2 April . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The UK was initially taken by surprise by the Argentine attack on the South Atlantic islands , despite repeated warnings by Royal Navy captain Nicholas Barker and others . Barker believed that Defence Secretary John Nott 's 1981 review ( in which Nott described plans to withdraw the Endurance , the UK 's only naval presence in the South Atlantic ) had sent a signal to the Argentines that the UK was unwilling , and would soon be unable , to defend its territories and subjects in the Falklands . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Falklands had only three airfields . The longest and only paved runway was at the capital , Stanley , and even that was too short to support fast jets ( although an arrestor gear was fitted in April to support Skyhawks ) . Therefore , the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland , severely hampering their efforts at forward staging , combat air patrols , and close air support over the islands . The effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft was low , and they were later compelled to overfly British forces in any attempt to attack the islands . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in Madrid , at which the two governments issued a joint statement . No change in either country 's position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit . In 1994 , Argentina 's claim to the territories was added to its constitution . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Many of the Argentine dead are buried in the Argentine Military Cemetery west of the Darwin Settlement . The government of Argentina declined an offer by the UK to have the bodies repatriated to the mainland . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The Argentine Navy used their last AM39 Exocet missile attempting to attack HMS Invincible on 30 May . There are Argentine claims that the missile struck ; however , the British have denied this , some citing that HMS Avenger shot it down . When Invincible returned to the UK after the war , she showed no signs of missile damage . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The first major Argentine strike force comprised 36 aircraft ( A-4 Skyhawks , IAI Daggers , English Electric Canberras , and Mirage III escorts ) , and was sent on 1 May , in the belief that the British invasion was imminent or landings had already taken place . Only a section of Grupo 6 ( flying IAI Dagger aircraft ) found ships , which were firing at Argentine defences near the islands . The Daggers managed to attack the ships and return safely . This greatly boosted morale of the Argentine pilots , who now knew they could survive an attack against modern warships , protected by radar ground clutter from the Islands and by using a late pop up profile . Meanwhile , other Argentine aircraft were intercepted by BAE Sea Harriers operating from HMS Invincible . A Dagger and a Canberra were shot down . \n",

      "1)Orbit of the Moon - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The Moon 's elongation is its angular distance east of the Sun at any time . At new moon , it is zero and the Moon is said to be in conjunction . At full moon , the elongation is 180 ° and it is said to be in opposition . In both cases , the Moon is in syzygy , that is , the Sun , Moon and Earth are nearly aligned . When elongation is either 90 ° or 270 ° , the Moon is said to be in quadrature . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) In representations of the Solar System , it is common to draw the trajectory of Earth from the point of view of the Sun , and the trajectory of the Moon from the point of view of Earth . This could give the impression that the Moon orbits Earth in such a way that sometimes it goes backwards when viewed from the Sun 's perspective . Because the orbital velocity of the Moon around Earth ( 1 km / s ) is small compared to the orbital velocity of Earth about the Sun ( 30 km / s ) , this never happens . There are no rearward loops in the Moon 's solar orbit . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) In effect , this means that the `` tropical year '' on the moon is only 347 days long . This is called the draconic year or eclipse year . The `` seasons '' on the moon fit into this period . For about half of this draconic year , the sun is north of the lunar equator ( but at most 1.543 ° ) , and for the other half , it is south of the lunar equator . Obviously , the effect of these seasons is minor compared to the difference between lunar night and lunar day . At the lunar poles , instead of usual lunar days and nights of about 15 Earth days , the sun will be `` up '' for 173 days as it will be `` down '' ; polar sunrise and sunset takes 18 days each year . `` Up '' here means that the centre of the sun is above the horizon . Lunar polar sunrises and sunsets occur around the time of eclipses ( solar or lunar ) . For example , at the Solar eclipse of March 9 , 2016 , the moon was near its descending node , and the sun was near the point in the sky where the equator of the moon crosses the ecliptic . When the sun reaches that point , the centre of the sun sets at the lunar north pole and rises at the lunar south pole . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The Moon is in synchronous rotation , meaning that it keeps the same face toward Earth at all times . This synchronous rotation is only true on average , because the Moon 's orbit has a definite eccentricity . As a result , the angular velocity of the Moon varies as it orbits Earth and hence is not always equal to the Moon 's rotational velocity . When the Moon is at its perigee , its rotation is slower than its orbital motion , and this allows us to see up to eight degrees of longitude of its eastern ( right ) far side . Conversely , when the Moon reaches its apogee , its rotation is faster than its orbital motion and this reveals eight degrees of longitude of its western ( left ) far side . This is referred to as longitudinal libration . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Moon is gradually receding from Earth into a higher orbit , and calculations suggest that this would continue for about 50 billion years . By that time , Earth and the Moon would be in a mutual spin -- orbit resonance or tidal locking , in which the Moon will orbit Earth in about 47 days ( currently 27 days ) , and both the Moon and Earth would rotate around their axes in the same time , always facing each other with the same side . This has already happened to the Moon -- the same side always faces Earth -- and is also slowly happening to the Earth . However , the slowdown of Earth 's rotation is not occurring fast enough for the rotation to lengthen to a month before other effects change the situation : approximately 2.3 billion years from now , the increase of the Sun 's radiation will have caused Earth 's oceans to evaporate , removing the bulk of the tidal friction and acceleration . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Considering the Earth -- Moon system as a binary planet , its centre of gravity is within Earth , about 4,624 km ( 2,873 mi ) or 72.6 % of the Earth 's radius from the centre of the Earth . This centre of gravity remains on the line between the centres of the Earth and Moon as the Earth completes its diurnal rotation . The path of the Earth -- Moon system in its solar orbit is defined as the movement of this mutual centre of gravity around the sun . Consequently , Earth 's centre veers inside and outside the solar orbital path during each synodic month as the Moon moves in its orbit around the common centre of gravity . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The Sun 's gravitational effect on the Moon is more than twice that of Earth 's on the Moon ; consequently , the Moon 's trajectory is always convex ( as seen when looking Sunward at the entire Sun -- Earth -- Moon system from a great distance outside Earth -- Moon solar orbit ) , and is nowhere concave ( from the same perspective ) or looped . That is , the region enclosed by the Moon 's orbit of the Sun is a convex set . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Because of the inclination of the moon 's orbit with respect to the earth 's equator , the moon is above the horizon at the North and South Pole for almost two weeks every month , even though the sun is below the horizon for six months at a time . The period from moonrise to moonrise at the poles is a tropical month , about 27.3 days , quite close to the sidereal period . When the sun is the furthest below the horizon ( winter solstice ) , the moon will be full when it is at its highest point . When the moon is in Gemini it will be above the horizon at the North Pole , and when it is in Sagittarius it will be up at the South Pole . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Because the lunar orbit is also inclined to Earth 's ecliptic plane by 5.1 ° , the rotational axis of the Moon seems to rotate towards and away from Earth during one complete orbit . This is referred to as latitudinal libration , which allows one to see almost 7 ° of latitude beyond the pole on the far side . Finally , because the Moon is only about 60 Earth radii away from Earth 's centre of mass , an observer at the equator who observes the Moon throughout the night moves laterally by one Earth diameter . This gives rise to a diurnal libration , which allows one to view an additional one degree 's worth of lunar longitude . For the same reason , observers at both of Earth 's geographical poles would be able to see one additional degree 's worth of libration in latitude . \n",

      "1)Vegas Golden Knights - Wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The team 's name includes `` Knights '' as a homage to the Black Knights of the United States Military Academy , Foley 's alma mater , and because knights were , according to Foley , `` the epitome of the warrior class '' . Foley had hoped to name his team the Black Knights , but dropped that plan after encountering resistance from federal officials . Foley was unable to call the team the `` Vegas Knights '' due to the London Knights owning the `` Knights '' name in Canada . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) On May 16 , 2017 , the Golden Knights entered a multi-year affiliation agreement with a minor league team , the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League . Like most NHL - AHL affiliation arrangements , the Golden Knights are able to transfer players to and from the Wolves . Although the Wolves are the Golden Knights affiliate , the two teams do not share the same ownership . In addition to the Wolves , the Golden Knights were affiliated with the Quad City Mallards of the ECHL for the 2017 -- 18 season , however , the Mallards ceased operations after the one season . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Vegas Golden Knights are a professional ice hockey team based in the Las Vegas metropolitan area . The team began play in the 2017 -- 18 NHL season , and is a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . The team is owned by Black Knight Sports & Entertainment , a consortium led by Bill Foley and the Maloof family . The team plays its home games at T - Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise , Nevada . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The United States Army initially expressed concern after the Golden Knights ' name was announced , because their parachute team uses the same nickname . The Army later disputed the trademark and colors of the team during its first season , to which the team responded : `` We are not aware of a single complaint from anyone attending our games that they were expecting to see the parachute team and not a professional hockey game . '' An objection was also raised by the College of Saint Rose because its sports teams use the same name ; the Vegas team 's initial trademark application was denied as a result , but was later approved on appeal . The team did clear the name with Clarkson University , which also uses the name Golden Knights . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) This is a complete list of the seasons completed by the Golden Knights . For the full season - by - season history , see List of Vegas Golden Knights seasons . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) At the league owners ' meeting on June 22 , 2016 , in Las Vegas , the Las Vegas expansion bid was approved by a unanimous vote , with play to begin in the 2017 -- 18 NHL season . The team became the first major professional sports franchise to be based in Las Vegas , and the first NHL expansion team since 2000 . Foley committed to pay the league 's $500 million expansion fee and began the process of hiring the team 's principal staff and determining its official identity . Foley announced that former Washington Capitals general manager George McPhee would be the franchise 's first general manager . On November 22 , 2016 , the name was revealed as the Vegas Golden Knights . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The NHL has had a presence in Las Vegas since 1991 , when an outdoor game was held in Las Vegas , with the Los Angeles Kings facing the New York Rangers outside Caesars Palace in a preseason exhibition game . The city has since hosted the Frozen Fury , a preseason competition between the Los Angeles Kings and the Colorado Avalanche , and the NHL Awards ceremonies have been held in Las Vegas since 2009 . In 2009 , the media speculated about a plan involving Hollywood producer Jerry Bruckheimer to move the Phoenix Coyotes to Nevada . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) On April 11 , the franchise won its first playoff game in a 1 -- 0 victory over the Los Angeles Kings in the first game of the series . Six days later on April 17 , the franchise earned their first playoff series win against the Kings , winning the fourth game by a 1 -- 0 score , which also became their first playoff series sweep . The Knights became the first team in NHL history to sweep their first playoff series in their inaugural season . On May 6 , 2018 , the Golden Knights defeated the San Jose Sharks four - games - to - two , becoming the third team in NHL history to win multiple playoff series in their inaugural season , and advanced to the Western Conference Finals . On May 20 , Vegas defeated the Winnipeg Jets to win the Western Conference Finals in five games , becoming the third NHL team to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals in its inaugural season , after the Toronto Arenas in 1918 and the St. Louis Blues in 1968 . The Golden Knights would lose the Stanley Cup Finals to the Washington Capitals in five games . The Golden Knights are the first , and to date only , true expansion team to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals in their inaugural season . The Golden Knights are additionally the fastest true expansion team to advance to the finals in the history of all four major professional leagues in North America . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The Golden Knights ' mascot is a Gila monster named Chance . He was unveiled at the team 's second home game on October 13 , 2017 . The team opted against using a knight for a mascot because it found that knight mascots used by other teams were not very child - friendly . \n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) This is related to the rhetorical device of hendiadys , where one concept is expressed through the use of two descriptive words or phrases . For example , `` goblets and gold '' meaning wealth , or `` this day and age '' meaning the present time . Superficially these expressions may seem tautological , but they are stylistically sound because the repeated meaning is just a way to emphasize the same idea . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) In literary criticism and rhetoric , a tautology is a statement which repeats the same idea , using near - synonymous morphemes , words , or phrases , that is , `` saying the same thing twice '' . Tautology and pleonasm are not consistently differentiated in the literature . \n",
      "\n",
      "3)Tautology ( language ) - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Parallelism is not tautology , but rather a particular stylistic device . Much Old Testament poetry is based on parallelism : the same thing said twice , but in slightly different ways ( Fowler puts it as pleonasm ) . However , modern biblical study emphasizes that there are subtle distinctions and developments between the two lines , such that they are usually not truly the `` same thing . '' Parallelism can be found wherever there is poetry in the Bible : Psalms , the Books of the Prophets , and in other areas as well . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The word was coined in Hellenistic Greek from ταὐτός ' the same plus λόγος ' word / idea '. , and transmitted through 3rd - century Latin tautologia and French tautologie . It first appears in English in the 16th century . The use in the term logical tautology was introduced in English by Wittgenstein in 1919 , perhaps following Auguste Comte 's usage in 1835 . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Sometimes logical tautologies like `` Boys will be boys '' are conflated with language tautologies , but in general , a rhetorical tautology is not inherently true . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The use of tautologies is , however , usually unintentional . For example , the phrases `` mental telepathy '' , `` planned conspiracies '' , and `` small dwarfs '' imply that there are such things as `` physical telepathy , spontaneous conspiracies , and giant dwarfs . '' ) \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Like pleonasm , it is often considered a fault of style when unintentional . On the other hand , an intentional repetition may be an effective way to emphasize a thought , or help the listener or reader understand a point . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Intentional repetition of meaning intends to amplify or emphasize a particular , usually significant , fact about what is being discussed . For example , a gift is , by definition , free of charge ; using the phrase `` free gift '' might emphasize that there are no hidden conditions or fine print , be it the expectation of money or reciprocation , or that the gift is being given by volition . \n",

      "1)High - and low - level - Wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) High - level and low - level are typically terms used to classify , describe and point to specific goals of a systematic operation , though its uses also vary depending on the context - such as use in computer science versus business administration . In general , high - level is used to describe operations that are more abstract in nature , where overall goals and systemic features are typically more concerned with the wider , macro system as a whole . Alternatively , a low - level description is one that describes more specific individual components of a systematic operation , focusing on the details of rudimentary micro functions rather than macro , complex processes . Low - level classification is typically more concerned with individual components within the system and how they operate . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Due to the nature of complex systems , the high - level description will often be completely different from the low level one . For example , there are features to an ant colony that are not features of any individual ant ; features of the human mind that are not known to be descriptive of individual neurons in the brain , features of oceans which are not features of any individual water molecule , and features to a human personality that are not features of any cell in a body . The descriptions of these differ depending at what level they are studied . Features which emerge only at a high level of description are known as epiphenomena . \n",

      "\n",
      "3) The office of the Prime Minister of Mauritius was created on 12 March 1968 when Mauritius became an independent state . Queen Elizabeth II remained as head of state as Queen of Mauritius , with her executive powers in Mauritius delegated to the governor - general . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Prime Minister of Mauritius ( French : Premier Ministre de Maurice ) is the head of government of Mauritius . He presides over the Cabinet of Ministers which advises the President of the Country and is collectively responsible to the National Assembly for any advice given and for all action done by or under the authority of any Minister in the execution of his office . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The Prime Minister is appointed by the President . He or She holds the second most senior position in the country , second only to the president . The Prime Minister is usually the leader of the largest party in the ruling coalition . The position of Prime Minister alongside with the office of Deputy Prime Minister is specified under CHAPTER VI Section 59 Part 1 of the Constitution of Mauritius . \n",

      "6) On 12 March 1992 , Mauritius became a Republic State , with a new constitution in 1992 , the terms of the General Elections was regulated to 5 years . Since then , each 5 years elections take place and a new Prime Minister is elected . After the 1995 General Election , Dr. Navin Ramgoolam became Prime Minister of Mauritius for the first time . However , he lost the 2000 General Election . In 2000 , the Prime Minister 's office was shared between two leaders , Sir Anerood Jugnauth spent 3 years as Prime Minister and Paul Bérenger spent 2 years . After the 2005 General Election , Dr. Navin Ramgoolam became the Prime Minister of Mauritius again . In 2010 General Election , he was re-elected and remained in office . The 2014 General Election returned Sir Anerood Jugnauth to the Prime Minister 's office . \n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0mMel Gibson says : `` This is a movie about love , hope , faith and forgiveness . He ( Jesus ) died for all mankind , suffered for all of us . It 's time to get back to that basic message . The world has gone nuts . We could all use a little more love , faith , hope and forgiveness . '' </P>\n",
      "\u001b[1mDocument url: \u001b[0mhttps://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=The_Passion_of_the_Christ&amp;oldid=818122402\n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1)The Passion of the Christ - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) According to Mel Gibson , the primary source material for The Passion of the Christ is the four canonical Gospel narratives of Christ 's passion . The film includes a trial of Jesus at Herod 's court , which is only found in the Gospel of Luke . Many of the utterances from Jesus in the film can not be directly sourced to the Gospel and are part of a wider Christian narrative . The film also draws from other parts of the New Testament . The line spoken by Jesus in the film , `` I make all things new , '' is found in the Book of Revelation . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Certain elements of The Passion of the Christ do not have precedent in earlier depictions of the Passion . In the Garden of Gethsemane scene at the beginning of the movie , Satan appears and attempts to distract Jesus while he is praying . Jesus then crushes a serpent beneath his heel ( a reference to the protoevangelium , Genesis 3 : 15 -- a prophecy of Messiah ) ; this does not occur in any of the gospels . In another example , Judas Iscariot is tormented by children who appear as demons to him . The film gives focus to the fragile relationship of Tiberius Caesar with Pontius Pilate through Pilate 's discussion with his wife about imperial orders to avert further Judean revolts . The movie clearly identifies Simon of Cyrene as Jewish , although the Synoptic Gospels provide only his name and place of origin . In the film , a Roman soldier derides Simon ( who helps Jesus bear the cross ) by derisively calling him Jew . In contrast , Simon is described as a pagan in The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ . Another major difference that passes most unnoticed is the INRI titulus on Christ 's cross which is written only in two languages ( however occupying three lines ) , instead of three as mentioned in the Gospels . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) In June 2016 , it was announced that Mel Gibson is working on a sequel to The Passion of the Christ , focusing on the resurrection of Jesus . The screenwriter is Randall Wallace , who wrote the screenplay for Braveheart ( 1995 ) . Gibson has expressed an interest in directing the film . He also said that the film will come out in a few years since it is a big project . In November 2016 , Gibson confirmed that the title of the sequel would be Resurrection and implied that part of the movie would be taking place in hell , stating that the film would explore what happened in the three - day period between the death of Jesus and his return . He also revealed that the film would probably be about three years away , because of its massive undertaking . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The film also refers to the Tanakh . The film begins with an epigraph from the Fourth Song of the Suffering Servant from Isaiah . In the opening scene set in the Garden of Gethsemane , Jesus crushes a serpent 's head in direct visual allusion to Genesis 3 : 15 . Throughout the film , Jesus quotes from the Psalms , beyond the instances recorded in the New Testament . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Many of the depictions in the film deliberately mirror traditional representations of the Passion in art . For example , the fourteen Stations of the Cross are central to the depiction of the Via Dolorosa in The Passion of the Christ . All the stations are portrayed except for the eighth station ( Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem , a deleted scene on the DVD ) and the fourteenth station ( Jesus is laid in the tomb ) . Gibson was also visually inspired by the representation of Jesus on the Shroud of Turin . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Other scenes unique to the film include the one in which the crucified thief who taunted Christ has his eye pecked out by a crow ( in some Catholic iconography a crow is represented above the bad thief and a dove or angel above the good thief ) and the flashback of Christ at an earlier time building an elevated , four - legged table for a Roman . The scene of Satan carrying a demonic baby during Christ 's flogging has been construed as a perversion of traditional depictions of the Madonna and Child , and also as a representation of Satan and the Antichrist .

      "8) Caiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate to be condemned to death , but after questioning Jesus and finding no fault , a sympathetic Pilate instead relays him to the court of Herod Antipas , as Jesus is from Antipas ' ruling town of Nazareth , Galilee . After Jesus is again found not guilty and returned , Pilate offers the crowd options for either him to chastise Jesus , or release him . He then attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples ' choice , between Jesus and a violent criminal Barabbas . To his dismay and anger , the crowd demands to have Barabbas freed and Jesus killed . In an attempt to appease the moment , Pilate orders that he simply be punished but not killed . Jesus is brutally scourged , abused , and mocked by the Roman guards as `` king of the Jews '' with a crown of thorns until Abenader , the general , angrily stops them . However , Caiaphas , with the crowds ' verbal backing , continues to demand that Jesus be crucified as a heretic and Barabbas released . Admonished , Pilate washes his hands , takes no responsibility of the incident , and reluctantly orders Jesus ' crucifixion . During the course of events , Satan watches Jesus ' bloody sufferings with great interest . A dismayed Pilate watches the march , while his wife Claudia , who knows of Jesus ' status as a holy man , comforts him . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The movie is 126 minutes long , and I would guess that at least 100 of those minutes , maybe more , are concerned specifically and graphically with the details of the torture and death of Jesus . This is the most violent film I have ever seen . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The conflation of Mary Magdalene with the adulteress saved from stoning by Jesus has some precedent in tradition , and according to the director was done for dramatic reasons . The names of some characters in the film are traditional and extra-Scriptural , such as the thieves crucified alongside the Christ , Dismas and Gesmas ( also Gestas ) . \n",

      "3) Chelsea as a Premier League team entered in the third round of the FA Cup against Championship club Norwich City on 7 January at Carrow Road , which ended with a 0 -- 0 draw . The replay was held 11 days later and was a 1 -- 1 draw with goals from Michy Batshuayi in the 55th minute and Jamal Lewis in the 90th minute , going to extra time and then a penalty shootout that Chelsea won 5 -- 3 . In the fourth round , they met Premier League opposition Newcastle United at Stamford Bridge , and won 3 -- 0 with two goals from Batshuayi and a one from Marcos Alonso . In the fifth round , Chelsea faced another Championship team , Hull City , and won 4 -- 0 with Willian ( 2 ) , Pedro and Olivier Giroud scoring . In the quarter - finals , they visited the King Power Stadium to face Leicester City , where a goal for Chelsea from Álvaro Morata and a Leicester equaliser from Jamie Vardy took the game to extra time , in which substitute Pedro came off the bench and scored the winning goal to take Chelsea to the semi-finals at Wembley to face Southampton . In that match , goals from both strikers Giroud and Morata were enough to see off Southampton 2 -- 0 to bring Chelsea back to the FA Cup Final for the second successive season . Chelsea are seeking their eighth FA Cup triumph . \n",

      "4) Manchester United , also of the Premier League , entered in the third round and were drawn at home against Championship side Derby County and won 2 -- 0 with goals from Jesse Lingard and Romelu Lukaku . In the next round , they were drawn against League Two club Yeovil Town at Huish Park and won 4 -- 0 with goals from Marcus Rashford , Ander Herrera , Jesse Lingard and Lukaku . In the fifth round , Manchester United were drawn with fellow Premier League side Huddersfield Town away at Kirklees Stadium , and Lukaku scored both goals in a 2 -- 0 win . In the quarter - finals , they played Premier League Brighton & Hove Albion at Old Trafford , and progressed due to goals by Lukaku and Nemanja Matić . In the semi-final at Wembley Stadium against Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur , Manchester United reached their 20th final after coming from behind to win 2 -- 1 with goals from Alexis Sánchez and Herrera . Manchester United were looking to match Arsenal 's record of 13 FA Cup wins . \n",

      "6) A Midsummer Night 's Dream is a comedy written by William Shakespeare in 1595 / 96 . It portrays the events surrounding the marriage of Theseus , the Duke of Athens , to Hippolyta , the former queen of the Amazons . These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors ( the mechanicals ) who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set . The play is one of Shakespeare 's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world . \n",

Helena , desperate to reclaim Demetrius 's love , tells Demetrius about the plan and he follows them in hopes of killing Lysander . Helena continually makes advances towards Demetrius , promising to love him more than Hermia . However , he rebuffs her with cruel insults against her . Observing this , Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man . Instead , Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius , not having actually seen either before , and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander . Helena , coming across him , wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep . Upon this happening , Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena . Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia and is enraged . When Demetrius goes to sleep , Oberon sends Puck to get Helena while he charms Demetrius ' eyes . Upon waking up , he sees Helena . Now , both men are in pursuit of Helena . However , she is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her , as neither loved her originally . Hermia is at a loss to see why her lover has abandoned her , and accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her . The four quarrel with each other until Lysander and Demetrius become so enraged that they seek a place to duel to prove whose love for Helena is the greater . Oberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from Lysander so Lysander can return to love Hermia , while Demetrius continues to love Helena . \n",

      "10) David Bevington argues that the play represents the dark side of love . He writes that the fairies make light of love by mistaking the lovers and by applying a love potion to Titania 's eyes , forcing her to fall in love with an ass . In the forest , both couples are beset by problems . Hermia and Lysander are both met by Puck , who provides some comic relief in the play by confounding the four lovers in the forest . However , the play also alludes to serious themes . At the end of the play , Hippolyta and Theseus , happily married , watch the play about the unfortunate lovers , Pyramus and Thisbe , and are able to enjoy and laugh at it . Helena and Demetrius are both oblivious to the dark side of their love , totally unaware of what may have come of the events in the forest . \n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) It is important to note that valuation requires judgment and assumptions : \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Valuation of financial assets is done using one or more of these types of models : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Additional adjustments to a valuation approach , whether it is market - , income - , or asset - based , may be necessary in some instances like : \n",
      "\n",
      "4)Valuation ( finance ) - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "5) In mining , valuation is the process of determining the value or worth of a mining property . Mining valuations are sometimes required for IPOs , fairness opinions , litigation , mergers and acquisitions , and shareholder - related matters . In valuation of a mining project or mining property , fair market value is the standard of value to be used . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) This method determines the value of a firm by observing the prices of similar companies ( called `` guideline companies '' ) that sold in the market . Those sales could be shares of stock or sales of entire firms . The observed prices serve as valuation benchmarks . From the prices , one calculates price multiples such as the price - to - earnings or price - to - book ratios -- one or more of which used to value the firm . For example , the average price - to - earnings multiple of the guideline companies is applied to the subject firm 's earnings to estimate its value . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The third-most common method of estimating the value of a company looks to the assets and liabilities of the business . At a minimum , a solvent company could shut down operations , sell off the assets , and pay the creditors . Any cash that would remain establishes a floor value for the company . This method is known as the net asset value or cost method . In general the discounted cash flows of a well - performing company exceed this floor value . Some companies , however , are worth more `` dead than alive '' , like weakly performing companies that own many tangible assets . This method can also be used to value heterogeneous portfolios of investments , as well as nonprofits , for which discounted cash flow analysis is not relevant . The valuation premise normally used is that of an orderly liquidation of the assets , although some valuation scenarios ( e.g. , purchase price allocation ) imply an `` in - use '' valuation such as depreciated replacement cost new . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) show many assets based on their historic costs rather than at their current market values . For instance , a firm 's balance sheet will usually show the value of land it owns at what the firm paid for it rather than at its current market value . But under GAAP requirements , a firm must show the fair values ( which usually approximates market value ) of some types of assets such as financial instruments that are held for sale rather than at their original cost . When a firm is required to show some of its assets at fair value , some call this process `` mark - to - market '' . But reporting asset values on financial statements at fair values gives managers ample opportunity to slant asset values upward to artificially increase profits and their stock prices . Managers may be motivated to alter earnings upward so they can earn bonuses . Despite the risk of manager bias , equity investors and creditors prefer to know the market values of a firm 's assets -- rather than their historical costs -- because current values give them better information to make decisions . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Common terms for the value of an asset or liability are market value , fair value , and intrinsic value . The meanings of these terms differ . For instance , when an analyst believes a stock 's intrinsic value is greater ( less ) than its market price , an analyst makes a `` buy '' ( `` sell '' ) recommendation . Moreover , an asset 's intrinsic value may be subject to personal opinion and vary among analysts . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Stock markets give indirectly an estimate of a corporation 's intangible asset value . It can be reckoned as the difference between its market capitalisation and its book value ( by including only hard assets in it ) . \n",

He is credited with the development of gambling and entertainment in Las Vegas and bringing the interests of the most powerful organized crime organizations in America to Nevada . Greene is in business with Don Vito Corleone , who bankrolls the creation of Greene 's first hotel - casino . In return , Greene takes the Don 's son Fredo under his wing during the war between the Five Families in New York , due to the intervention of West Coast Don Francesco . Although Fredo is greatly influenced by both Greene and the city , family heir Michael Corleone disapproves of the effect it has on his brother , whom Greene reportedly chastised and slapped around in public . \n",

      "2) On April 5 , 1967 , the same day the Apollo 1 investigation released its final report on the fire , Armstrong assembled with 17 other astronauts for a meeting with Slayton . The first thing Slayton said was , `` The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room . '' According to Cernan , one of the astronauts present , Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement . To Armstrong it came as no surprise -- the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini , the only people who could fly the lunar missions . Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9 , which at that stage was planned to be a medium Earth orbit test of the Lunar Module -- Command / Service Module combination . \n",

      "3) In July 1969 , Armstrong and Apollo 11 Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin performed the first manned Moon landing , and spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command / Service Module . When Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface , he famously said : `` That 's one small step for ( a ) man , one giant leap for mankind . '' Along with Collins and Aldrin , Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon . President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong with the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978 , and Armstrong and his former crewmates received a Congressional Gold Medal in 2009 . \n",

Armstrong 's final task was to remind Aldrin to leave a small package of memorial items to Soviet cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Vladimir Komarov , and Apollo 1 astronauts Grissom , White and Chaffee . The time spent on EVA during Apollo 11 was two and a half hours ; each of the subsequent five landings was allotted a progressively longer period for EVA activities -- the crew of Apollo 17 spent over 22 hours exploring the lunar surface . In a 2010 interview , Armstrong explained that NASA limited his Moon walk because they were unsure how the spacesuits would cope with the extremely high temperature on the Moon . \n",

      "5) After Armstrong served as backup commander for Apollo 8 , Slayton offered him the post of commander of Apollo 11 on December 23 , 1968 , as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon . In a meeting that was not made public until the publication of Armstrong 's biography in 2005 , Slayton told him that although the planned crew was Armstrong as Commander , Lunar Module ( LM ) Pilot Buzz Aldrin and Command Module ( CM ) Pilot Michael Collins , he was offering Armstrong the chance to replace Aldrin with Jim Lovell . After thinking it over for a day , Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin , as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command . Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the Lunar Module Pilot , unofficially the lowest ranked member , and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell , the commander of Gemini 12 , in the number 3 position of the crew . The crew of Apollo 11 was officially announced on January 9 , 1969 , as Armstrong , Collins and Aldrin , with Lovell , Anders and Fred Haise as the backup crew . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group , which was selected in 1962 . He made his first spaceflight as commander of Gemini 8 in March 1966 , becoming NASA 's first civilian astronaut to fly in space . During this mission with pilot David Scott , he performed the first docking of two spacecraft ; the mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster . During training for Armstrong 's second and last spaceflight as commander of Apollo 11 , he had to eject from the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle moments before a fiery crash . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In a 2010 Space Foundation survey , Armstrong was ranked as the # 1 most popular space hero , and in 2013 , Flying magazine ranked him at # 1 on its list of the `` 51 Heroes of Aviation '' . The press often asked Armstrong for his views on the future of spaceflight . In 2005 , Armstrong said that a manned mission to Mars will be easier than the lunar challenge of the 1960s . In 2010 , he made a rare public criticism of the decision to cancel the Ares I launch vehicle and the Constellation Moon landing program . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Aldrin called him `` a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew '' , and said he was disappointed that they would not be able to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing together in 2019 . Collins said : `` He was the best , and I will miss him terribly . '' NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said that : `` As long as there are history books , Neil Armstrong will be included in them , remembered for taking humankind 's first small step on a world beyond our own '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) After being released from an 18 - day quarantine to ensure that they had not picked up any infections or diseases from the Moon , the crew were feted across the United States and around the world as part of a 45 - day `` Giant Leap '' tour . Armstrong then took part in Bob Hope 's 1969 USO show , primarily to Vietnam . In May 1970 , Armstrong traveled to the Soviet Union to present a talk at the 13th annual conference of the International Committee on Space Research ; after arriving in Leningrad from Poland , he traveled to Moscow where he met Premier Alexei Kosygin . Armstrong was the first westerner to see the supersonic Tupolev Tu - 144 and was given a tour of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center , which he described as `` a bit Victorian in nature '' . At the end of the day , he was surprised to view delayed video of the launch of Soyuz 9 -- it had not occurred to Armstrong that the mission was taking place , even though Valentina Tereshkova had been his host and her husband , Andriyan Nikolayev , was on board . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The lunar crater Armstrong , 31 miles ( 50 km ) from the Apollo 11 landing site , and asteroid 6469 Armstrong are named in his honor . There are more than a dozen elementary , middle and high schools named in his honor in the United States , and many places around the world have streets , buildings , schools , and other places named for Armstrong and / or Apollo . The Armstrong Air and Space Museum , in Armstrong 's hometown of Wapakoneta , and the airport in New Knoxville , Ohio , where he took his first flying lessons when he was fifteen , are named after him . Purdue University announced in October 2004 that its new engineering building would be named Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering in his honor ; the building was dedicated on October 27 , 2007 , during a ceremony at which Armstrong was joined by fourteen other Purdue Astronauts . The NASA Dryden Flight Research Center was renamed the NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center in 2014 . \n",

      "1)British Empire - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) By the start of the 20th century , Germany and the United States had begun to challenge Britain 's economic lead . Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War , during which Britain relied heavily upon its empire . The conflict placed enormous strain on the military , financial and manpower resources of Britain . Although the British Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after World War I , Britain was no longer the world 's pre-eminent industrial or military power . In the Second World War , Britain 's colonies in Southeast Asia were occupied by Japan . Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies , the damage to British prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire . India , Britain 's most valuable and populous possession , achieved independence as part of a larger decolonisation movement in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the empire . The transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire . Fourteen overseas territories remain under British sovereignty . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The independence of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after the American War of Independence caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies . British attention soon turned towards Asia , Africa , and the Pacific . After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars ( 1792 -- 1815 ) , Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century . Unchallenged at sea , British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica ( `` British Peace '' ) , a period of relative peace in Europe and the world ( 1815 -- 1914 ) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman . In the early 19th century , the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain ; so that by the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 , the country was described as the `` workshop of the world '' . The British Empire expanded to include most of India , large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world . Alongside the formal control that Britain exerted over its own colonies , its dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions , such as Asia and Latin America . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) In 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , ascended ( as James I ) to the English throne and in 1604 negotiated the Treaty of London , ending hostilities with Spain . Now at peace with its main rival , English attention shifted from preying on other nations ' colonial infrastructures to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies . The British Empire began to take shape during the early 17th century , with the English settlement of North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean , and the establishment of joint - stock companies , most notably the East India Company , to administer colonies and overseas trade . This period , until the loss of the Thirteen Colonies after the American War of Independence towards the end of the 18th century , has subsequently been referred to by some historians as the `` First British Empire '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Political boundaries drawn by the British did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions , contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas . The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples . Millions left the British Isles , with the founding settler populations of the United States , Canada , Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland . Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities , and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe . Settlers in Ireland from Great Britain have left their mark in the form of divided nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland . Millions of people moved to and from British colonies , with large numbers of Indians emigrating to other parts of the empire , such as Malaysia and Fiji , and Chinese people to Malaysia , Singapore and the Caribbean . The demographics of Britain itself was changed after the Second World War owing to immigration to Britain from its former colonies . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The British and French struggles in India became but one theatre of the global Seven Years ' War ( 1756 -- 1763 ) involving France , Britain and the other major European powers . The signing of the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) had important consequences for the future of the British Empire . In North America , France 's future as a colonial power effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to Rupert 's Land , and the ceding of New France to Britain ( leaving a sizeable French - speaking population under British control ) and Louisiana to Spain . Spain ceded Florida to Britain . Along with its victory over France in India , the Seven Years ' War therefore left Britain as the world 's most powerful maritime power . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council still serves as the highest court of appeal for several former colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific . British missionaries who travelled around the globe often in advance of soldiers and civil servants spread Protestantism ( including Anglicanism ) to all continents . The British Empire provided refuge for religiously persecuted continental Europeans for hundreds of years . British colonial architecture , such as in churches , railway stations and government buildings , can be seen in many cities that were once part of the British Empire . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War , the effects of the conflict were profound , both at home and abroad . Much of Europe , a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries , was in ruins , and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union , who now held the balance of global power . Britain was left essentially bankrupt , with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $ US 4.33 billion loan from the United States , the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006 . At the same time , anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations . The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union . In principle , both nations were opposed to European colonialism . In practice , however , American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism , and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in check . The `` wind of change '' ultimately meant that the British Empire 's days were numbered , and on the whole , Britain adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies once stable , non-Communist governments were available to transfer power to . This was in contrast to other European powers such as France and Portugal , which waged costly and ultimately unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact . Between 1945 and 1965 , the number of people under British rule outside the UK itself fell from 700 million to five million , three million of whom were in Hong Kong . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Under the terms of the concluding Treaty of Versailles signed in 1919 , the empire reached its greatest extent with the addition of 1,800,000 square miles ( 4,700,000 km ) and 13 million new subjects . The colonies of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were distributed to the Allied powers as League of Nations mandates . Britain gained control of Palestine , Transjordan , Iraq , parts of Cameroon and Togoland , and Tanganyika . The Dominions themselves also acquired mandates of their own : the Union of South Africa gained South West Africa ( modern - day Namibia ) , Australia gained New Guinea , and New Zealand Western Samoa . Nauru was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific Dominions . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) No further attempts to establish English colonies in the Americas were made until well into the reign of Queen Elizabeth I , during the last decades of the 16th century . In the meantime , the 1533 Statute in Restraint of Appeals had declared `` that this realm of England is an Empire '' . The subsequent Protestant Reformation turned England and Catholic Spain into implacable enemies . In 1562 , the English Crown encouraged the privateers John Hawkins and Francis Drake to engage in slave - raiding attacks against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of West Africa with the aim of breaking into the Atlantic slave trade . This effort was rebuffed and later , as the Anglo - Spanish Wars intensified , Elizabeth I gave her blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic , laden with treasure from the New World . At the same time , influential writers such as Richard Hakluyt and John Dee ( who was the first to use the term `` British Empire '' ) were beginning to press for the establishment of England 's own empire . By this time , Spain had become the dominant power in the Americas and was exploring the Pacific Ocean , Portugal had established trading posts and forts from the coasts of Africa and Brazil to China , and France had begun to settle the Saint Lawrence River area , later to become New France . \n",

      "9) Later in the year , Ninjago ended its second season still having positive feedback . A new show titled Legends of Chima would air in January 2013 . The show was faster and more productive than Ninjago and it received mixed reviews . In the same year , the `` Piece of Resistance '' film would be renamed `` The Lego Movie '' by Warner Bros. and it was released in February 2014 . The Lego Movie received wide acclaim from Lego fans and critics for its characters , plot , special effects and humor . Many actors from the Lego universe came to reprise their roles in the film . Due to the success of the film , a Ninjago film was announced to be released in 2017 , and a `` Lego Movie '' sequel was announced to be released in 2018 . In 2014 , Mixels also debuted . In late 2015 , Lego Nexo Knights was introduced , replacing Legends of Chima . On February 10 , 2017 , a spin - off film of The Lego Movie known as The Lego Batman Movie was released in theaters , only this time , the film 's story centers around The Lego Movie character and DC Comics superhero , Batman , and his `` adopted orphan son '' and apprentice sidekick , Robin . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Brickfilms , videos using Lego , have existed since the 1970s . Starting in 2003 , Lego officially made their first film partnership to make films based on their toy property . They chose Bionicle as the property and they made a deal with Miramax to make a trilogy of Bionicle films . Over the years , after the trilogy ended , a new trilogy based on Bionicle was planned with Universal Pictures after the Miramax film contract ended and the first film in the new trilogy would be titled Bionicle : The Legend Reborn . But plans broke between Lego and Universal so they cancelled the fifth film in the series . But they continued on with a film titled Lego : The Adventures of Clutch Powers . The film received positive reviews from fans and critics and after the DVD release , a sequel was set to star Clutch as the hero again . A mini-sequel and a short film based on Clutch Powers were released and plans for a sequel are unknown . \n",

      "1) A metal ( from Greek μέταλλον métallon , `` mine , quarry , metal '' ) is a material ( an element , compound , or alloy ) that is typically hard when in solid state , opaque , shiny , and has good electrical and thermal conductivity . Metals are generally malleable -- that is , they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking -- as well as fusible ( able to be fused or melted ) and ductile ( able to be drawn out into a thin wire ) . About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals ; the others are nonmetals or metalloids . Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The electrical and thermal conductivities of metals originate from the fact that their outer electrons are delocalized . This situation can be visualized by seeing the atomic structure of a metal as a collection of atoms embedded in a sea of highly mobile electrons . The electrical conductivity , as well as the electrons ' contribution to the heat capacity and heat conductivity of metals can be calculated from the free electron model , which does not take into account the detailed structure of the ion lattice . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) In chemistry , the term base metal is used informally to refer to a metal that is easily oxidized or corroded , and reacts easily with dilute hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) to form metal chloride and hydrogen . Examples include iron , nickel , lead and zinc . Copper is considered a base metal as it is oxidized relatively easily , although it does not react with HCl . Base metal is commonly used in opposition to noble metal . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Atoms of metals readily lose their outer shell electrons , resulting in a free flowing cloud of electrons within their otherwise solid arrangement . This provides the ability of metallic substances to easily transmit heat and electricity . While this flow of electrons occurs , the solid characteristic of the metal is produced by electrostatic interactions between each atom and the electron cloud . This type of bond is called a metallic bond . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Noble metals are metals that are resistant to corrosion or oxidation , unlike most base metals . They tend to be precious metals , often due to perceived rarity . Examples include gold , platinum , silver , rhodium , iridium and palladium . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The transition metals ( such as iron , copper , zinc , and nickel ) are slower to oxidize because they form a passivating layer of oxide that protects the interior . Others , like palladium , platinum and gold , do not react with the atmosphere at all . Some metals form a barrier layer of oxide on their surface which can not be penetrated by further oxygen molecules and thus retain their shiny appearance and good conductivity for many decades ( like aluminium , magnesium , some steels , and titanium ) . The oxides of metals are generally basic , as opposed to those of nonmetals , which are acidic . Exceptions are largely oxides with very high oxidation states such as CrO , Mn O , and OsO , which have strictly acidic reactions . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The elements which are considered as metals under ordinary conditions are shown in yellow on the periodic table below . The remaining elements are shown either as nonmetals or as metalloids of intermediate character . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In alchemy , a base metal was a common and inexpensive metal , as opposed to precious metals , mainly gold and silver . A longtime goal of the alchemists was the transmutation of base metals into precious metals . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Metals in general have high electrical conductivity , high thermal conductivity , and high density . Typically they are malleable and ductile , deforming under stress without cleaving . In terms of optical properties , metals are shiny and lustrous . Sheets of metal beyond a few micrometres in thickness appear opaque , but gold leaf transmits green light . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Although most metals have higher densities than most nonmetals , there is wide variation in their densities , lithium being the least dense solid element and osmium the densest . The alkali and alkaline earth metals in groups IA and II A are referred to as the light metals because they have low density , low hardness , and low melting points . The high density of most metals is due to the tightly packed crystal lattice of the metallic structure . The strength of metallic bonds for different metals reaches a maximum around the center of the transition metal series , as those elements have large amounts of delocalized electrons in tight binding type metallic bonds . However , other factors ( such as atomic radius , nuclear charge , number of bonds orbitals , overlap of orbital energies and crystal form ) are involved as well . \n",

      "\u001b[1mDocument url: \u001b[0mhttps://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Active_transport&amp;oldid=839384184\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Unlike passive transport , which uses the kinetic energy and natural entropy of molecules moving down a gradient , active transport uses cellular energy to move them against a gradient , polar repulsion , or other resistance . Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs , such as ions , glucose and amino acids . If the process uses chemical energy , such as from adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , it is termed primary active transport . Secondary active transport involves the use of an electrochemical gradient . Examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the uptake of mineral ions into root hair cells of plants . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Active transport is the movement of molecules across a membrane from a region of their lower concentration to a region of their higher concentration -- in the direction against the concentration gradient . Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement . There are two types of active transport -- primary active transport that uses ATP , and secondary active transport that uses an electrochemical gradient . An example of active transport in human physiology is the uptake of glucose in the intestines . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Primary active transport , also called direct active transport , directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane . Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions , such as Na , K , Mg , and Ca . These charged particles require ion pumps or ion channels to cross membranes and distribute through the body . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Specialized transmembrane proteins recognize the substance and allow it to move across the membrane when it otherwise would not , either because the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane is impermeable to the substance moved or because the substance is moved against the direction of its concentration gradient . There are two forms of active transport , primary active transport and secondary active transport . In primary active transport , the proteins involved are pumps that normally use the chemical energy in the form of ATP . Secondary active transport , however , makes use of potential energy , which is usually derived through exploitation of an electrochemical gradient . The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient . This involves pore - forming proteins that form channels across the cell membrane . The difference between passive transport and active transport is that the active transport requires energy , and moves substances against their respective concentration gradient , whereas passive transport requires no energy and moves substances in the direction of their respective concentration gradient . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) In secondary active transport , also known as coupled transport or cotransport , energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane ; however , in contrast to primary active transport , there is no direct coupling of ATP ; instead it relies upon the electrochemical potential difference created by pumping ions in / out of the cell . Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient , but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases entropy and can serve as a source of energy for metabolism ( e.g. in ATP synthase ) . The energy derived from the pumping of protons across a cell membrane is frequently used as the energy source in secondary active transport . In humans , sodium ( Na ) is a commonly co-transported ion across the plasma membrane , whose electrochemical gradient is then used to power the active transport of a second ion or molecule against its gradient . In bacteria and small yeast cells , a commonly cotransported ion is hydrogen . Hydrogen pumps are also used to create an electrochemical gradient to carry out processes within cells such as in the electron transport chain , an important function of cellular respiration that happens in the mitochondrion of the cell . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Most of the enzymes that perform this type of transport are transmembrane ATPases . A primary ATPase universal to all animal life is the sodium - potassium pump , which helps to maintain the cell potential . The sodium - potassium pump maintains the membrane potential by moving three Na+ ions out of the cell for every two K+ ions moved into the cell . Other sources of energy for Primary active transport are redox energy and photon energy ( light ) . An example of primary active transport using Redox energy is the mitochondrial electron transport chain that uses the reduction energy of NADH to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient . An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in photosynthesis that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane and also to create reduction power in the form of NADPH . \n",

      "7) In an antiporter , one substrate is transported in one direction across the membrane while another is cotransported in the opposite direction . In a symporter , two substrates are transported in the same direction across the membrane . Antiport and symport processes are associated with secondary active transport , meaning that one of the two substances is transported against its concentration gradient , utilizing the energy derived from the transport of another ion ( mostly Na , K or H ions ) down its concentration gradient . \n",

      "8)Active transport - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Endocytosis and exocytosis are both forms of bulk transport that move materials into and out of cells , respectively , via vesicles . In the case of endocytosis , the cellular membrane folds around the desired materials outside the cell . The ingested particle becomes trapped within a pouch , known as a vesicle , inside the cytoplasm . Often enzymes from lysosomes are then used to digest the molecules absorbed by this process . Substances that enter the cell via signal mediated endocytosis include proteins , hormones and growth factors . Viruses enter cells through a form of endocytosis that involves their outer membrane fusing with the membrane of the cell . This forces the viral DNA into the host cell . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Plants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources , but these salts exist in very dilute solution . Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the concentration gradient . For example , the molecules chlorine ( Cl ^ - ) and nitrate NO3 - exist in the cytosol of plant cells , and need to be transported into the vacuole . While the vacuole has channels for these ions , transportation of them is against the concentration gradient , and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps , or proton pumps \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Minuit is generally credited with orchestrating the purchase of Manhattan Island for the Dutch from the Lenape Native Americans . Manhattan later became the site of the Dutch city of New Amsterdam , and the borough of Manhattan of modern - day New York City . A common account states that Minuit purchased Manhattan for $24 worth of trinkets . A letter written by Dutch merchant Peter Schaghen to directors of the Dutch East India Company stated that Manhattan was purchased `` for the value of 60 guilders '' in goods , an amount worth approximately $1,050 in 2015 dollars . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Minuit is credited with purchasing the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans in exchange for traded goods valued at 60 guilders . According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley , Minuit conducted the transaction with Seyseys , chief of the Canarsees , who were only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for an island that was mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks . \n",
      "\n",
      "3)Peter Minuit - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Minuit married Gertrude Raedts on August 20 , 1613 . Gertrude was from a wealthy family and she probably helped Peter Minuit establish himself as a broker . A will drawn up in 1615 in the Dutch city of Utrecht , mentions `` Peter Minnewit '' as a diamond cutter . Whether he traded in other items is unknown . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) A contemporary purchase of rights in nearby Staten Island , to which Minuit also was party , involved duffel cloth , iron kettles , axe heads , hoes , wampum , drilling awls , `` Jew 's harps '' , and `` diverse other wares '' . `` If similar trade goods were involved in the Manhattan arrangement '' , Burrows and Wallace surmise , `` then the Dutch were engaged in high - end technology transfer , handing over equipment of enormous usefulness in tasks ranging from clearing land to drilling wampum . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "6) After having lived in Cleves , Germany for several years , Minuit made arrangements with Samuel Blommaert and the Swedish government in 1636 or 1637 to create the first Swedish colony in the New World . Located on the lower Delaware River within territory earlier claimed by the Dutch , it was called New Sweden . Minuit and his company arrived on the Fogel Grip and Kalmar Nyckel at Swedes ' Landing ( now Wilmington , Delaware ) , in the spring of 1638 . They constructed Fort Christina later that year , then returned to Stockholm for a second load of colonists , and made a side trip to the Caribbean on the return to pick up a shipment of tobacco for resale in Europe to make the voyage profitable . During this voyage , Minuit drowned when the ship he was visiting ( at the invitation of it 's dutch captain , a friend of Minuit ) , The Flying Deer , was lost with all hands during a hurricane at St. Christopher ( today 's St. Kitts ) in the Caribbean . The losses suffered , such as goods , colonists , and Minuit , caused irreversible damage to Sweden 's colonization attempts . Two years later , Swedish Lt. Måns Nilsson Kling , whose rank was raised to captain , replaced him as governor . Nine expeditions to the colony were carried out before the Dutch captured it in 1655 . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Peter Minuit , Pieter Minuit , Pierre Minuit , or Peter Minnewit ( between 1580 and 1585 -- August 5 , 1638 ) was a Walloon from Wesel , in present - day North Rhine - Westphalia , Germany , then part of the Duchy of Cleves . His surname means `` midnight '' in French . He was Director of the Dutch North American colony of New Netherland from 1626 until 1631 , and founded the Swedish colony of New Sweden on the Delaware Peninsula in 1638 . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Minuit and his family joined the Dutch West India Company , probably in the mid-1620s , and was sent to New Netherland in 1625 to search for tradable goods other than the animal pelts that then were the major product coming from New Netherland . He returned in the same year , and in 1626 was appointed the new director of New Netherland , taking over from Willem Verhulst . He sailed to North America and arrived in the colony on May 4 , 1626 . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) By 1624 , the city was in an economic decline and in 1625 , he had left Wesel and like others , went to Holland . At first , Gertrude went to stay with her relatives in Cleve . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The figure of 60 guilders comes from a letter by a representative of the Dutch States - General and member of the board of the Dutch West India Company , Pieter Janszoon Schagen , to the States - General in November 1626 . In 1846 , New York historian John Romeyn Brodhead converted the figure of Fl 60 ( or 60 guilders ) to US $ 23 . The popular account rounds this off to $24 . By 2006 sixty guilders in 1626 was worth approximately $1,000 in current dollars , according to the Institute for Social History of Amsterdam . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P>\n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . \n",

      "1) In the season 8 episode `` Band or DJ ? , '' Ted runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute . The end result of the encounter is that Cindy 's ( now ex - ) roommate 's band plays at Barney and Robin 's wedding . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) A petition was started , aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale . The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage . On April 5 , 2014 , Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD . No new material was shot for this scene . In the alternate ending , the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Some time after this , a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics . Darren gradually takes over the band . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) In the season 6 opener `` Big Days '' it is revealed Ted meets his future wife `` the day of '' the wedding at which he is the best man . In the episode `` False Positive '' Robin asks Ted to be her future best man , should she ever get married . In the episode `` Challenge Accepted '' , it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney 's wedding . In the last episode of season 7 , `` The Magician 's Code '' it is shown that Barney will marry Robin , and Ted will meet the mother `` the day of '' their wedding . On the premiere of season 8 , Ted 's wife appears after Barney and Robin 's wedding , outside at the `` Farhampton '' station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) During its first eight seasons , the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother . Well - known actresses often made guest appearances on the show . Many fans expected that another would play one of the most - wanted roles in Hollywood , but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown . Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples , Thomas said that `` We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience '' , similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had `` kept the show alive '' when it began . Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once ; her musical ability was also helpful , as The Mother had been described as a band member . After competing for the role against at least two others , Milioti filmed her first scene -- for the last episode of season 8 -- having never watched How I Met Your Mother ; she recalled , `` I had ignorance on my side . So I did n't know what it meant . '' Milioti learned of the character 's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In `` Wait for It '' , it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella . In `` No Tomorrow '' , Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick 's Day party which she also attended , as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max , her late boyfriend . She is still grieving , but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again , bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating . The two women run into Mitch , her old orchestra instructor ; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment . After they start talking , Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams . The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The Mother was born on September 19 , 1984 . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is shown that after this incident , the Mother returns to Louis ' summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend . As she walks in the door , Louis proposes to her , but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes . She declines Louis ' proposal and leaves his cottage , going to check in at Farhampton Inn . On her room 's balcony , she plays the ukulele and sings `` La Vie en Rose '' . Ted hears her singing from his room next door . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD . In the alternate ending , Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . In the video , future Ted is heard saying , `` ... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning , I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was ... '' , indirectly stating that The Mother is alive . The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling , implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby . \n",

      "\n",
      "2) The average time to birth has been estimated to be 268 days ( 38 weeks and two days ) from ovulation , with a standard deviation of 10 days or coefficient of variation of 3.7 % . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) In preparation for the fusion of their genetic material both the oocyte and the sperm undergo transformations as a reaction to the fusion of cell membranes . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The pronuclei migrate toward the center of the oocyte , rapidly replicating their DNA as they do so to prepare the zygote for its first mitotic division . \n",

      "\n",
      "6) Various disorders can arise from defects in the fertilization process . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Where the spermatozoon is about to pierce , the yolk ( ooplasm ) is drawn out into a conical elevation , termed the cone of attraction or reception cone . Once the spermatozoon has entered , the peripheral portion of the yolk changes into a membrane , the perivitelline membrane , which prevents the passage of additional spermatozoa . \n",

      "8) In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb , in vitro . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Fertilization age is sometimes used postnatally ( after birth ) as well to estimate various risk factors . For example , it is a better predictor than postnatal age for risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature babies treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) After binding to the corona radiata the sperm reaches the zona pellucida , which is an extra-cellular matrix of glycoproteins . A special complementary molecule on the surface of the sperm head binds to a ZP3 glycoprotein in the zona pellucida . This binding triggers the acrosome to burst , releasing enzymes that help the sperm get through the zona pellucida . \n",

      "2) The winters are typically milder than in inland areas , averaging lows in the upper 30s and highs in the lower 50s , and is more frequently overcast than in the summer . However , the exposure of the Outer Banks makes them prone to higher winds , often causing wind chills to make the apparent temperature as cold as the inland areas . The summer months average lows from the mid-70s to highs in the upper 80s , depending on the time of the summer . The spring and fall are typically milder seasons . The fall and winter are usually warmer than areas inland , while the spring and the summer are often slightly cooler because of the moderating effects of being surrounded by water . \n",

European explorers to the Outer Banks as far back as the 1500s noted encountering the friendly Hatteras Island and Outer Banks natives , noting their hospitality to foreign explorers as well as their happiness and overall quality of life .

The peak for fishing bottom and top water feeders is early to the middle of May . If the angler is solely searching for top water fish , then late May and June would be the ideal time to fish , especially if they are searching for Mackerel . In the offseason , or winter months , the true fishermen are out searching for Trout , Sea Bass , Bluefish , Bluefin Tuna , Oysters , King Mackerel , Bay Scallops , and Striped Bass . In the spring , the popular catches are Grouper , Sea Trout , Sea Bass , Bluefish , Bluefin and Yellowfin tuna , Oysters , Snapper , Striped Bass , Red Drum , Croaker , Sea Mullet , King Mackerel , and Wahoo Late Spring and the beginning of summer is the favored time for top - water fish to move into the coastal waters near the Outer Banks , because of the warming waters and the increased visibility in the water The top water fish can see baitfish easily due to the decrease in murky water Plus they will start to migrate back North as the coastal waters to the south become too hot , the waters farther North will warm to their desired temperatures . Yet , in the prime tourist season of the summer , fishermen and many tourists have plenty of game options such as blue Marlin , White Marlin , Dolphin , Wahoo , Cobia , King Mackerel , Bluefish , Tuna , Flounder , snapper , Grouper , Spanish Mackerel , Crabs , Soft Crabs , Shrimp , Spot , Croaker , Sailfish , and Sea Mullet . By the fall , most tourists have started to leave , but fishermen are still out searching for Snapper , Channel Bass , Bluefish , King Mackerel , Grouper , Tuna , Oysters , Striped Bass , Sea Mullet , Spot , Clams , Speckled Trout , Flounder , and Shrimp . The prime season for fall fishing is late September to October 23 . Though the water is more turbulent and murky due to the strong northeast prevailing winds , there is still some big game fish left . Most of these fish are vacating back to the South for the warm waters . This makes it a prime time for smaller bottom fish who love to feed in murky , colder water . \n",
