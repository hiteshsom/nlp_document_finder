The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Later , in `` Girls Versus Suits '' , Ted dates Cindy , not knowing that her roommate is his future wife . Throughout the episode , Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate . When in Cindy and the mother 's apartment he picks up many of The Mother 's belongings , attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are ( thinking the items are Cindy 's ) and glimpses the mother 's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower . Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band . Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions , `` this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back . '' In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is revealed that , after Ted left the apartment , the Mother had discovered the umbrella and , upon going to question Cindy , finds her in a state . As she tried to console her , Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted , and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive , before spontaneously kissing her , revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush . While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian , it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating , as the kiss was her first in a long time . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Mother , joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death . After the funeral service , she returns to the apartment to open Max 's last gift to her -- a ukulele . The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) In the series finale , it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children , Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness . In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead . Ted says that she `` became sick '' and his children saying that she has been `` gone '' for six years . Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother 's death . Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die , but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning . Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was `` an amazing character '' and that `` over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy . Kuchman said that `` asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request '' , that the finale `` advanced too quickly '' and that `` HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In a flashforward in `` The Lighthouse '' , Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn . She immediately accepts . In another flashfoward in `` Unpause '' , the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child , Luke , in the year 2017 . She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series , including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment . Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky 's wedding ; this scene is shown in `` Last Forever '' , the series finale . The Mother 's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024 , also revealed in the series finale , received a mixed reaction from fans . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The Mother meets all of Ted 's best friends ( Barney , Lily , Marshall and Robin ) before she meets him . The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin , as revealed through a flashback in `` Platonish '' . In `` The Locket '' , Tracy meets Lily on a train journey . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The Mother 's real name is not revealed until the series finale , `` Last Forever '' . When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station , she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell . In the season 1 episode `` Belly Full of Turkey '' , Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says `` ... that , kids , is the true story of how I met your mother '' . The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking , which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother 's name is Tracy . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The Mother is first shown meeting Louis in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now - lead band member Darren talks to his fans . Later at MacLaren 's Pub , she tells him she 's not yet ready to date . Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products .

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : \n",
      "\n",
      "3)Email marketing - Wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Email marketing is the act of sending a commercial message , typically to a group of people , using email . In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . </P>\n",

      "1)Human fertilization - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm , usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell , or fertilized egg , initiating prenatal development . Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Usually 23 chromosomes from spermatozoon and 23 chromosomes from egg cell fuse ( half of spermatozoons carry X chromosome and the other half Y chromosome ) . Their membranes dissolve , leaving no barriers between the male and female chromosomes . During this dissolution , a mitotic spindle forms between them . The spindle captures the chromosomes before they disperse in the egg cytoplasm . Upon subsequently undergoing mitosis ( which includes pulling of chromatids towards centrioles in anaphase ) the cell gathers genetic material from the male and female together . Thus , the first mitosis of the union of sperm and oocyte is the actual fusion of their chromosomes . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The sperm 's tail and mitochondria degenerate with the formation of the male pronucleus . This is why all mitochondria in humans are of maternal origin . Still , a considerable amount of RNA from the sperm is delivered to the resulting embryo and likely influences embryo development and the phenotype of the offspring . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The sperm binds through the corona radiata , a layer of follicle cells on the outside of the secondary oocyte . Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell , known as zygote . The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The oocyte completes its second meiotic division . This results in a mature ovum . The nucleus of the oocyte is called a pronucleus in this process , to distinguish it from the nuclei that are the result of fertilization . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) After the sperm enters the cytoplasm of the oocyte ( also called ovocyte ) , the tail and the outer coating of the sperm disintegrate and the cortical reaction takes place , preventing other sperm from fertilizing the same egg . The oocyte now undergoes its second meiotic division producing the haploid ovum and releasing a polar body . The sperm nucleus then fuses with the ovum , enabling fusion of their genetic material . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Some sperm cells consume their acrosome prematurely on the surface of the egg cell , facilitating the penetration by other sperm cells . As a population , sperm cells have on average 50 % genome similarity so the premature acrosomal reactions aid fertilization by a member of the same cohort . It may be regarded as a mechanism of kin selection . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Once the sperm cells find their way past the zona pellucida , the cortical reaction occurs . Cortical granules inside the secondary oocyte fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell , causing enzymes inside these granules to be expelled by exocytosis to the zona pellucida . This in turn causes the glyco - proteins in the zona pellucida to cross-link with each other -- i.e. the enzymes cause the ZP2 to hydrolyse into ZP2f -- making the whole matrix hard and impermeable to sperm . This prevents fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm . The cortical reaction and acrosome reaction are both essential to ensure that only one sperm will fertilize an egg . \n",

      "1)Roanoke Colony - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) John Lawson wrote in his 1709 work A New Voyage to Carolina that the Croatans living on Hatteras Island used to live on Roanoke Island and claimed to have white ancestors : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Once the Jamestown settlement was established in 1607 , efforts were undertaken by the English to acquire information from the Powhatan tribe about Roanoke . The first definitive information concerning the fate of the Lost Colony came from Captain John Smith , leader of the Jamestown Colony from 1608 to 1609 . According to chronicler Samuel Purchas , Smith learned from Chief Powhatan that he had personally conducted the slaughter of the Roanoke colonists just prior to the arrival of the Jamestown settlers because they were living with the Chesepians , a tribe living in the eastern portion of the present - day South Hampton Roads sub-region who were related to the Pamlico tribe in Carolina and who refused to merge with the Powhatans . This shocking information was reported to England and by the spring of 1609 , King James and the Royal Council were convinced that Chief Powhatan was responsible for the slaughter of the Lost Colony . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The colonists disappeared during the Anglo - Spanish War , three years after the last shipment of supplies from England . Their disappearance gave rise to the nickname `` The Lost Colony '' . There is no conclusive evidence as to what happened to the colonists . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) However , the case was far from settled . A similar legend claims that the now extinct Saponi of Person County , North Carolina , are descended from the English colonists of Roanoke Island . However , no documented evidence exists to link the Saponi to the Roanoke colonists . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Harriot reports that relations between the Roanoke Indians and the English settlers were mutually calm and prosperous , contradicting other historical evidence that catalogs the bloody struggles between the Roanoke Indians and both of Raleigh 's commanders , Sir Richard Grenville and his successor , Ralph Lane . Harriot recounts little to none of these accounts in his report to England and does not mention the disorderly state of the colony under either Grenville 's or Lane 's tenure , correctly assuming these facts would prevent Roanoke from gaining more settlers . Harriot 's text did not reach England , or the English press , until 1588 , by which time the fate of the `` Lost Colony '' was sealed in all but name . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The Roanoke Colony ( / ˈroʊəˌnoʊk / ) , also known as the Lost Colony , was established in 1585 on Roanoke Island in what is today 's Dare County , North Carolina . It was a late 16th - century attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent English settlement in North America . The colony was founded by Sir Walter Raleigh . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In 1587 , Raleigh dispatched a new group of 115 colonists to establish a colony on Chesapeake Bay . They were led by John White , an artist and friend of Raleigh who had accompanied the previous expedition to Roanoke , and was appointed governor of the 1587 colony . White and Raleigh named 12 assistants to aid in the settlement . They were ordered to stop at Roanoke to pick up the small contingent left there by Grenville the previous year , but when they arrived on July 22 , 1587 , they found nothing except a skeleton that may have been the remains of one of the English garrison . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Between their arrival in Roanoke in April 1585 and the July 1586 departure , Harriot and White both conducted detailed studies of the Roanoke area , with Harriot compiling his samples and notes into several notebooks that did not survive the colony 's disappearance . Harriot also wrote descriptions of the surrounding flora and fauna of the area , which survive in his work A Brief and True Report of the New Founde Land of Virginia , written as a report on the colony 's progress to the English government on the request of Raleigh . Viewed by modern historians as propaganda for the colony , this work has become vastly important to Roanoke 's history due to Harriot 's observations on wildlife as well as his depictions of Indian activities at the time of the colony 's disappearance . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The researchers concluded that the settlers of the Lost Colony landed at Roanoke Island in the summer of the worst growing - season drought in 800 years . `` This drought persisted for 3 years , from 1587 to 1589 , and is the driest 3 - year episode in the entire 800 - year reconstruction , '' the team reported in the journal Science . A map shows that `` the Lost Colony drought affected the entire southeastern United States but was particularly severe in the Tidewater region near Roanoke ( Island ) . '' The authors suggested that the Croatan who were shot and killed by the colonists may have been scavenging the abandoned village for food as a result of the drought . \n",

      "\n",
      "2) Klementieff moved to Los Angeles after Oldboy was filmed and began pursuing more Hollywood auditions . She continued taekwondo after the film , and has a purple belt as of the summer of 2014 . Her next acting role was the film Hacker 's Game ( 2015 ) , in which she plays a hacker she compared to Lisbeth Salander from the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo . Klementieff used her boxing skills again in the film , and due to the movie 's low budget , she had to do her own make - up and chose her own wardrobe . It was her idea to dye her hair purple for the role , to which the directors first objected but later acquiesced . She joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe with her role as Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ( 2017 ) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers : Infinity War ( 2018 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Klementieff made her Hollywood debut in Spike Lee 's Oldboy ( 2013 ) , a remake of the South Korean film of the same name . She portrayed Haeng - Bok , the bodyguard of the antagonist played by Sharlto Copley . A fan of the original film , Klementieff heard about the part through Roy Lee , a producer with the remake , and took boxing lessons after learning the role involved martial arts . After showcasing her boxing skills during her audition , Lee asked her to go home and come back wearing a more feminine outfit and make - up , like her character in the film . She contributed some of her own clothes to the character 's wardrobe , and trained three hours a day for two months for an on - screen fight with star Josh Brolin . Klementieff came up with the name Haeng - Bok , Korean for `` happiness '' , herself after Lee asked her to research possible names for the character . \n",
      "\n",
      "4)Pom Klementieff - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Klementieff 's first professional acting job was the French independent film Après lui ( 2007 ) , portraying the stepdaughter of the protagonist played by Catherine Deneuve . Filming for her scenes took three days . During one scene , Klementieff was supposed to push someone down a set of stairs but accidentally fell down the stairs herself , and director Gaël Morel kept that shot in the final film . Her first leading role was in Loup ( 2009 ) , a French film about a tribe of reindeer herders in the Siberian mountains . During filming , Klementieff stayed in a camp , hours from the nearest village , where temperatures dropped well below zero . During filming she befriended nomads who lived there , worked with real wolves , rode reindeer , and swam with a horse in a lake . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Pom Klementieff was born in Quebec City , Quebec , Canada , to a Korean mother and French - Russian father , who was working there as a consul with the French government . She had a brother who committed suicide . Her parents chose the name `` Pom '' because it is similar in pronunciation to the Korean words for both `` spring '' ( 봄 ) and `` tiger '' ( 범 ) . Klementieff lived in Canada for one year before her family traveled extensively due to her father 's job , and she lived in Japan and the Ivory Coast before settling in France . Klementieff later said that travelling at an early age gave her a `` gypsy soul '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Klementieff 's father died of cancer when she was 5 , and her mother was schizophrenic and unable to care for children , so Klementieff was raised by her paternal uncle and aunt . Her uncle , whom she described as `` like my second father '' , died on her 18th birthday . Klementieff briefly attended law school after her uncle 's death to appease her aunt , but did not find the career path appealing . She also worked as a waitress and saleswoman in France . She started acting at age 19 at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris . A few months into her education , she won a theater competition that awarded her free classes for two years with the school 's top teachers . \n",

      "\n",
      "2) The end credits show all the characters the next Christmas marching through the town square with Frosty in the lead , singing the `` Frosty the Snowman '' song . Among them is a redeemed Professor Hinkle , who is proudly wearing his new top hat . At the end of the parade , Frosty gets back into Santa 's waiting sleigh and they return to the North Pole , with Frosty proclaiming , `` I 'll be back on Christmas Day ! '' \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Frosty returned in several sequels : \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Hocus brings Santa Claus to the greenhouse only to find Karen in tears and Frosty melted on the floor due to Hinkle 's cruel act . Santa explains to Karen that Frosty is made from Christmas snow , and that he can never completely disappear , only take the form of summer rain , until next December . With a gust of cold wind through the open greenhouse door , the puddle that was Frosty blows out the door and magically changes back into his typical snowman form . Before Santa can put the finishing touch on Frosty and bring him back to life , as Hocus arrives with the hat , Hinkle arrives on the scene and again demands the return of his hat . He relents only when threatened with being removed from Santa 's Christmas list for the rest of his life if he put so much as one finger on the hat . Santa states that if Hinkle is truly repentant for his mean attitude and harming Frosty , and if he goes home and writes `` I am really sorry for what I did to Frosty '' a hundred zillion times , he may find a gift in his stocking on Christmas morning , which makes Hinkle bid Frosty and Karen farewell and run home to repeatedly write his apologies , assuming he may get a new hat . Finally , Santa then places the magic hat back on top of Frosty 's head , and the snowman returns to life again . After celebrating , Santa takes Karen home and Frosty to the North Pole , but promises that Frosty will be back next winter . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) One December afternoon , a little girl named Karen and her friends create a snowman after a class Christmas party at school . After several suggestions of what to call their snowman ( including `` Oatmeal '' and `` Christopher Columbus '' ) , Karen decides to name him `` Frosty . '' Later , the children acquire a top hat discarded by inept magician Professor Hinkle . Karen places the hat on top of Frosty 's head , and the snowman comes to life ( and always says `` Happy Birthday ! '' in response ) . When Hinkle learns of the magic power his hat actually possesses , he takes it back and departs , pretending that he did not see Frosty come to life . However , the professor 's pet rabbit , Hocus Pocus , returns the hat to Frosty and the children . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Frosty the Snowman is a 1969 animated Christmas television special based on the song `` Frosty the Snowman '' . The program , which first aired on December 7 , 1969 on CBS ( where it continues to air annually ) , was produced for television by Rankin / Bass Productions and featured the voices of comedians Jimmy Durante as the film 's narrator ( Durante 's final performance in a film ) and Jackie Vernon as the title character . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Family Home Entertainment released Frosty the Snowman on VHS as part of the Christmas Classics Series in 1989 and 1993 , with multiple re-prints throughout the 1990s . It was paired with The Little Drummer Boy on LaserDisc in 1992 . Upon its 1989 and 1993 releases , the special was also bundled in box sets with the other Rankin / Bass Christmas specials including Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer and Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town , the 1973 Chuck Jones holiday special , A Very Merry Cricket and the sequel Frosty Returns which aired on CBS in 1992 . In 1998 , Sony Wonder and Golden Books Family Entertainment released the special on VHS , and also paired it with these other Rankin / Bass Christmas specials including Cricket on the Hearth in the separate Holiday Classics Collection box sets . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Frosty soon senses the temperature is rising and worries about melting away . The children suggest putting him on the next train to the North Pole , where he will never melt , and they all parade into the city on the way to the train station , where Frosty has his confrontation with the traffic cop mentioned in the song 's lyrics . When Karen explains that Frosty came to life and does n't know what a traffic light or a lamp post is , the traffic cop lets Frosty go . At the train station , Frosty stows away aboard a refrigerated train car , since neither he nor the children have any money for a train ticket . As the train is about to leave the station , Karen and Hocus decide to join Frosty for the ride to keep him company . With that , Frosty , Karen , and Hocus wave goodbye to the other kids as the train takes off . Unbeknownst to them , Hinkle has also hitched a ride on the train , intending to get his hat back . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Released by Rhino on October 1 , 2002 , the entire audio portion of Frosty the Snowman is available on CD along with the entire audio portion of Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town , the Rankin / Bass special produced in 1970 . This edition contains the full dialogue and song audio of both specials . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) As the train continues up north , however , Frosty notices Karen is freezing and starting to catch a cold , so they jump off the train , leaving Hinkle behind once again . Hinkle , seeing them escape , jumps off the train too , but falls down a mountain and crashes into a tree where a pile of snow falls on him . At Frosty 's request , Hocus convinces some forest animals who are preparing for Christmas to build a campfire for Karen . Fearing that Karen still can not survive for long in the cold weather , Frosty asks Hocus who might be able to help them . Hocus suggests ( by pantomiming ) the President of the United States and the United States Marines , before suggesting Santa Claus . Frosty agrees , and promptly takes credit for the idea himself ( much to Hocus ' annoyance ) . Hocus hops off to get Santa , but Hinkle then confronts Frosty and Karen once more and blows out Karen 's campfire . Frosty and Karen are again forced to flee , this time with Karen riding on Frosty 's back as he slides head - first down a hill . At the bottom of the slope , Karen and Frosty discover a greenhouse filled with Christmas poinsettias . Despite Karen 's objections , Frosty steps inside the warm greenhouse with her , suggesting that he could afford to lose a little weight while she warms up . Unfortunately , an angry and vengeful Hinkle catches up to them immediately after and locks them in the greenhouse . \n",

      "1) The survival of the Acadian settlements was based on successful cooperation with the Indigenous peoples of the region .

Many settlers also brought French wives with them to Acadia , such as La Tour 's second wife , Françoise - Marie Jacquelin , who joined him in Acadia in 1640 . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) There was already a long history of Acadian and Wabanaki Confederacy resistance to the British occupation of Acadia during the four French and Indian Wars and two local wars ( Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) before the Expulsion of the Acadians . The Mi'kmaq and the Acadians were allies through Catholicism and through numerous inter-marriages . The Mi'kmaq held the military strength in Acadia even after the conquest of 1710 . They primarily resisted the British occupation of Acadia and were joined in their efforts on numerous occasions by Acadians . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The history of the Acadians was significantly influenced by the six colonial wars that took place in Acadia during the 17th and 18th century ( see the four French and Indian Wars , Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) . Eventually , the last of the colonial wars -- the French and Indian War -- resulted in the British Expulsion of the Acadians from the region . After the war , many Acadians came out of hiding or returned to Acadia from the British Colonies . Others remained in France and some migrated from there to Louisiana , where they became known as Cajuns , a corruption of the word Acadiens or Acadians . The nineteenth century saw the beginning of the Acadian Renaissance and the publication of Evangeline , which helped galvanize Acadian identity . In the last century Acadians have made achievements in the areas of equal language and cultural rights as a minority group in the Maritime provinces of Canada . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) While many Acadians traded with the New England Protestants , Acadians ' participation in the wars clearly indicated that many were reluctant to be ruled by the British . During the first colonial war , King William 's War ( 1688 -- 97 ) , the crews of the very successful French privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste were primarily Acadian . The Acadians resisted during the Raid on Chignecto ( 1696 ) . During Queen Anne 's War , Mi'kmaq and Acadians resisted during the Raid on Grand Pré , Piziquid and Chignecto in 1704 . The Acadians also assisted the French in protecting the capital in the Siege of Port Royal ( 1707 ) and the final Conquest of Acadia . The Acadians and Mi'kmaq were also successful in the Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1711 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) After the end of the Seven Years ' War in 1763 , Acadians were allowed to return to Nova Scotia as long as they did not settle in any one area in large numbers ; they were not permitted to resettle in the areas of Port Royal or Grand - Pré . Some Acadians resettled along the Nova Scotia coast and remain scattered across Nova Scotia to this day . Many dispersed Acadians looked for other homes . Beginning in 1764 , groups of Acadians began to arrive in Louisiana ( which had passed to Spanish control in 1762 ) . They eventually became known as Cajuns . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Some Acadians escaped into the woods and lived with the Mi'kmaq ; some bands of partisans fought the British , including a group led by Joseph Broussard , known as `` Beausoleil '' , along the Petitcodiac River of New Brunswick . Some followed the coast northward , facing famine and disease . Some were recaptured , facing deportation or imprisonment at Fort Beausejour ( renamed Fort Cumberland ) until 1763 . \n",

      "9) Kennedy ( 2014 ) argues that the emigrants from the Vienne region of France carried to Acadia their customs and social structure . They were frontier people , who dispersed their settlements based on kinship . They optimized use of farmland and emphasized trading for a profit . They were hierarchical and politically active . The French and the Acadian villages were similar in terms of prosperity , egalitarianism , and independent - mindedness . Kennedy says the emergence of a distinct Acadian identity emerged from the gradual adaptation of traditional French methods , institutions , and ideas to the North American environmental and political situations . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Beginning in the 1770s , many Acadians were encouraged to return through the policies of Nova Scotia Governor Michael Francklin , who guaranteed Catholic worship , land grants and issued a promise that there would be no second expulsion ( At this time , Nova Scotia included present - day New Brunswick ) . However the fertile Acadian dykelands had been resettled by New England Planters , who were soon followed by Loyalists who further occupied former Acadian lands . Returning Acadians and those families who had escaped expulsion had to settle in other parts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick , in most cases isolated and infertile lands . The new Acadian settlements were forced to focus more on fishery and later forestry . \n",

It is separated by the Currituck Sound and the Intracoastal Waterway , which passes through the Great Dismal Swamp occupying much of the mainland west of the Outer Banks . Road access to the northern Outer Banks is cut off between Sandbridge and Corolla , North Carolina , with communities such as Carova Beach accessible only by four - wheel drive vehicles . North Carolina State Highway 12 links most of the popular Outer Banks communities in this section of the coast . The easternmost point is Cape Point at Cape Hatteras on Hatteras Island , site of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Outer Banks ( OBX ) is a 200 - mile - long ( 320 km ) string of barrier islands and spits off the coast of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia , on the east coast of the United States . They cover most of the North Carolina coastline , separating the Currituck Sound , Albemarle Sound , and Pamlico Sound from the Atlantic Ocean . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The abbreviations OBX ( Outer Banks ) and SOBX ( Southern Outer Banks ) are modern terms used to promote tourism and to market a variety of stickers , t - shirts , and other items to vacationers . OBX , which originated first , is generally used in the northern Outer Banks . SOBX is used primarily in Carteret County , which is also known as the Crystal Coast . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Outer Banks stretch southward from Sandbridge in Virginia Beach down the North Carolina coastline . Sources differ regarding the southern terminus of the Outer Banks . Generations of North Carolina schoolchildren have learned that the term includes the state 's three prominent capes : Cape Hatteras , Cape Lookout , and Cape Fear . Other sources limit the definition to two capes ( Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout ) and coastal areas in four counties ( Currituck County , Dare County , Hyde County , and Carteret County ) . Some authors include Carteret 's Shackelford Banks and Bogue Banks in their descriptions , while others exclude Bogue Banks . Still other references restrict the definition to the northern three counties of Currituck , Dare , and Hyde . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The vegetation of the Outer Banks varies . In the northeast part of the Outer Banks , from Virginia Beach southward past the North Carolina border to Oregon Inlet , the main types of vegetation are sea grasses , beach grasses and other beach plants including Opuntia humifusa on the Atlantic side and wax myrtles , bays , and grasses on the Sound side with areas of pine and Spanish moss - covered live oaks . Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa can be found growing wild here in the northern parts of its range on the beach . Sabal Minor palms were once indigenous to the entire Outer Banks , and they are still successfully planted and grown . Its current most northerly known native stand is on Monkey Island in Currituck County . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) From Cape Hatteras National Seashore southward , the vegetation does include that of the northeastern Outer Banks such as Sabal minor , Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa ; however , the main vegetation consists of Cabbage palmetto ( Sabal palmetto ) , which can be found in the north , although they are native in the southern part of the Outer Banks , specifically prevalent from Cape Hatteras and all points southward . Pindo palms and windmill palms are also planted widely throughout the Outer Banks ; although , they are not indigenous to the area . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Before bridges were built in the 1930s , the only form of transport between or off the islands was by boat , which allowed for the islands to stay isolated from much of the rest of the mainland . This helped to preserve the maritime culture and the distinctive Outer Banks accent or brogue , which sounds more like an English accent than it does an American accent . Many `` bankers '' have often been mistaken for being from England or Ireland when traveling to areas outside of the Outer Banks . The brogue is more distinctive the further south one travels on the Outer Banks , with it being the thickest on Ocracoke Island and Harkers Island . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The Outer Banks is a string of peninsulas and barrier islands separating the Atlantic Ocean from mainland North Carolina . From north to south , the largest of these include : Bodie Island ( which used to be an island but is now a peninsula due to tropical storms and hurricanes ) , Hatteras Island , Ocracoke Island , Portsmouth Island , and the Core Banks . Over time , the exact number of islands and inlets changes as new inlets are opened up , often during a breach created during violent storms , and older inlets close , usually due to gradually sifting sands during the dynamic processes of beach evolution . \n",

      "2) As prescribed by the New Central Bank Act , the main functions of the Bangko Sentral are : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Within the Manila complex of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is the Museo ng Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ( English : Museum of the Central Bank of the Philippines ) . Inaugurated on January 3 , 1999 , as part of the celebration of the 50 years of central banking in the Philippines , the museum showcases the Bank 's collection of currencies . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ( lit . Central Bank of the Philippines ; commonly abbreviated as BSP in both Filipino and English ) is the central bank of the Philippines . It was established on 3 July 1993 , pursuant to the provision of Republic Act 7653 or the New Central Bank Act of 1993 . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) By 1933 , a group of Filipinos had conceptualised a central bank for the Philippine Islands . It came up with the rudiments of a bill for the establishment of a central bank after a careful study of the economic provisions of the Hare -- Hawes -- Cutting Act , which would grant Philippine independence after 12 years , but reserving military and naval bases for the United States and imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports . However , the Hare -- Hawes -- Cutting Act would be rejected by the Senate of the Philippines at the urging of Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon . This Senate then advocated a new bill that won United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's support , this would be the Tydings -- McDuffie Act , which would grant Philippine independence on July 4 , 1946 . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Bangko Sentral has 19 currencies directly convertible with the Philippine piso , which serves as a benchmark for all Philippine banks . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Shortly after President Manuel Roxas assumed office in 1946 , he instructed then - Finance Secretary Miguel Cuaderno , Sr. to draw up a charter for a central bank . The establishment of a monetary authority became imperative a year later as a result of the findings of the Joint Philippine - American Finance Commission chaired by Cuaderno . The Commission , which studied Philippine financial , monetary , and fiscal problems in 1947 , recommended a shift from the dollar exchange standard to a managed currency system . A central bank was necessary to implement the proposed shift to the new system . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The current members of the Monetary Board are : \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In accordance with a provision in the 1987 Constitution , President Fidel V. Ramos signed Republic Act No. 7653 , otherwise known as the New Central Bank Act , into law on June 14 , 1993 . The law provides for the establishment of an independent monetary authority to be known as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas , its primary objective being the maintenance of price stability . This objective was only implied in the old Central Bank charter . The law also gives the Bangko Sentral fiscal and administrative autonomy which the old Central Bank did not have . On July 3 , 1993 , the New Central Bank Act took effect . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Under the Commonwealth , discussions continued regarding the idea of a Philippine central bank that would promote price stability and economic growth . The country 's monetary system then was administered by the Department of Finance and the National Treasury , and the Philippine piso was on the exchange standard using the United States dollar , which was backed by 100 percent gold reserve , as the standard currency . \n",

      "\u001b[1mQuestion 13: actual time taken from start to finish to produce one unit of value ?\u001b[0m\n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Short Answer: \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[1mDocument url: \u001b[0mhttps://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Takt_time&amp;oldid=800753460\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Takt time can be first determined with the formula : \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Takt time is the average time between the start of production of one unit and the start of production of the next unit , when these production starts are set to match the rate of customer demand . For example , if a customer wants 10 units per week , then , given a 40 - hour work week and steady flow through the production line , the average time between production starts should be 4 hours , yielding 10 units produced per week . Note , a common misconception is that takt time is related to the time it takes to actually make the product . In the previous example , whether it takes 4 minutes or 4 years to produce the product , the takt time should be 4 hours ( of course , the time it takes to produce the product will impact the magnitude of the number of units actually in production at any point in time ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Assuming a product is made one unit at a time at a constant rate during the net available work time , the takt time is the amount of time that must elapse between two consecutive unit completions in order to meet the demand . \n",
      "\n",
      "4)Takt time - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Where T = Takt time , e.g. ( work time between two consecutive units ) T = Net time available to work , e.g. ( work time per period ) D = Demand ( customer demand ) , e.g. ( units required per period ) \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Some of the early literature uses cycle time for takt time . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Once a takt system is implemented there are a number of benefits : \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Downsides of takt time organization include : \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Also , takt time may be adjusted according to requirements within the company . For example , if one department delivers parts to several manufacturing lines , it often makes sense to use similar takt times on all lines to smooth out flow from the preceding station . Customer demand can still be met by adjusting daily working time , reducing down times on machines and so on . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Example : If there are a total of 8 hours ( or 480 minutes ) in a shift ( gross time ) less 30 minutes lunch , 30 minutes for breaks ( 2 × 15 mins ) , 10 minutes for a team briefing and 10 minutes for basic maintenance checks , then the net Available Time to Work = 480 - 30 - 30 - 10 - 10 = 400 minutes . \n",

      "1)I Had trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The book is a first - person narrative told by a young narrator who experiences troubles in his life ( mostly aggressive small animals that bite and sting ) and wishes to escape them . He sets out for the city of Solla Sollew ( `` where they never have troubles / at least very few '' ) and learns that he must face his problems instead of running away from them . He then goes back home to deal with his `` troubles '' , arming himself with a big bat and resolving that `` Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me ! '' \n",
      "\n",
      "3) At first , the protagonist considers joining the doorman , but realizing that he 's come all this way for nothing , the protagonist , instead , decides to go back home to the Valley of Vung and face his troubles . He now knows he will have troubles for the rest of his life , but he 's ready for them . Armed with a bat , the Protagonist now gives the rocks , quail , skritz , and skrink troubles of their own ( `` But I 've bought a big bat . I 'm all ready , you see . Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me ! '' ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew is a 1965 children 's book by Dr. Seuss . The story features classic Seuss rhymes and drawings in his distinctive pen and ink style . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) As the protagonist tries to fight off his troubles , a man on a One Wheel Wubble drawn by a camel comes up and explains that like the protagonist , he too is experiencing a troubled life and has decided to escape his troubles by going to Solla Sollew , a city on the beautiful banks of the river Wah - Hoo , and known to never have troubles ( at least very few ) . He invites the protagonist to come along with him . Eager to escape his troubles , the protagonist joins the wubble driver , but after a long night of traveling , the camel gets sick and starts to bubble . At first , the driver and protagonist pull him on the wubble , but for the rest of the day , the driver acts lazy and has the protagonist do all the hard work . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The journey includes several fantastic , and troublesome , encounters . In one instance , the protagonist is forced to haul a wagon for a bossy companion . ( `` ' This is called teamwork . I furnish the brains . You furnish the muscles , the aches and the pains . ' '' ) In another scene , he is drafted into the army under the command of the fearsome ( and , ultimately , cowardly ) General Genghis Kahn Schmitz , who abandons him at a critical moment . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) At the gates of Solla Sollew , the protagonist is greeted by a friendly doorman . The doorman explains to the protagonist about the only trouble the city has : a key - slapping slippard has moved into the lock of the door , which happens to be the only way into Solla Sollew , and bugs the doorman by continuously slapping the key out of his hand , preventing anyone from entering the city . As it 's considered bad luck to kill a slippard , the doorman can not do anything to evict this pest , but decides instead to leave Solla Sollew for the city of Boola Boo Ball , on the banks of the beautiful river Woo - Wall , and known to never have troubles ( `` No troubles at all ! ! '' ) and invites the protagonist to come along . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The next day they thankfully discover a camel doctor , Dr. Sam Snell , who diagnoses their camel with a bad case of gleeks and orders him to bed for twenty weeks . The driver makes it up to the protagonist by telling him he can catch the 4 : 42 bus to Solla Sollew at the nearest bus stop , but when the protagonist gets to the bus stop he learns from a sign tacked on a stick that the Solla Sollew bound bus is out of service ( the driver , Butch Myers , apparently destroyed all his tires from accidentally running over four nails ) , leaving him to hike for one hundred miles . Soon , the poor protagonist is caught in a storm . A kindly stranger tells him that the storm is the infamous `` Midwinter Jicker '' and allows the protagonist to take shelter in his house , where a family of mice and a family of owls are also taking shelter . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The protagonist manages to escape the Poozers by diving down an air vent marked `` Vent No. 5 '' but has to spend the next three days trying to find his way through a network of tunnels inhabited by birds , all going in the wrong direction . Close to the end of the third day , he finally finds a door and discovers he 's come out at the beautiful banks of the river Wah - Hoo . Realizing he 's reached his goal , the protagonist rushes out to Solla Sollew . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) After a sleepless night and dreaming of sleeping in Solla Sollew , the protagonist awakens to find that the flood - waters have washed the house over a cliff , with him still inside . He spends twelve days in the flood - waters , until somebody rescues him by throwing down a rope . The protagonist climbs the rope , only to discover that his savior is General Genghis Kahn Schmitz , who immediately drafts him into his army for an upcoming battle against the Perilous Poozer of Pompelmoose Pass , a lion - like creature . At the pass , the General discovers he and his army are outnumbered by too many Poozers and orders an immediate retreat without fighting , leaving the protagonist to face the Poozers alone , armed only with `` a shooter and one little bean '' . \n",

      "1) `` Shape of You '' is a song by English singer - songwriter Ed Sheeran . It was released as a digital download on 6 January 2017 as one of the double lead singles from his third studio album ÷ ( 2017 ) , along with `` Castle on the Hill '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The dancehall - infused pop song was written by Ed Sheeran together with Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid , with additional writing credits given to Kandi Burruss , Tameka `` Tiny '' Cottle , and Kevin `` She'kspere '' Briggs as Sheeran had incorporated an interpolation of the TLC 's song `` No Scrubs '' into `` Shape of You '' . The song was produced by Sheeran and Mac . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) According to Sheeran , Steve Mac started the song - writing session by playing the opening notes of the song on the keyboard . Sheeran then joined in , adding percussion by tapping on the guitar , layering it onto the track . On the writing of the song , he said that he tried to keep the music `` more stripped '' instead of something more elaborate : `` I 'm an acoustic artist , first and foremost . And when I play live , I ca n't replicate these things , I have n't got all the other musicians . '' Sheeran said he wanted an R&B feel to the song , therefore he adjusted the original tune , adding an interpolation of `` No Scrubs '' onto part of the melody . He also revealed that the original lyrics did not end with the words `` the shape of you '' in the chorus , but during the writing of the song , McDaid thought that the lyrics `` I 'm in love with your body '' sounded objectifying , and the lyrics was therefore adjusted . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The song was the last song written for Sheeran 's third album ÷ . On 6 January 2017 , when hosting The Radio 1 Breakfast Show , Sheeran revealed that `` Shape of You '' had originally been written with Rihanna in mind . As he had already written all the songs he wanted for the album , the song was therefore not intended to be included in the album . It was conceived as a duet between Rihanna and Rudimental , but the head of the record label convinced him to keep the song for himself . He said : \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Jon Caramanica from The New York Times said , `` ' Shape of You ' is trickier , a nimble and effective song that takes the aggressive thinning of ' Caribbean music ' . '' Billboard 's Taylor Weatherby wrote about the song saying , `` ' Shape of You ' does n't quite sound like your typical Sheeran tune . But that almost serves as an indication of what the `` Thinking Out Loud '' singer has been up to during his hiatus : creating music that still feels like Sheeran , just with a new twist . '' Jeremy Gordon of Spin gave the song a positive review , stating that the song `` is a plausible attempt at convincing us he has had sex ... a lot of it . It kind of slaps , though you ca n't really picture Sheeran ever saying ' put that body on me ' to a real human woman . '' News website Metro wrote that it sounds similar to the song `` Cheap Thrills '' by Sia . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) `` Shape of You '' is a pop , dancehall and tropical house song with `` strummy acoustics . '' In the song , Sheeran sings over a marimba - fueled percussive sway about a budding romance . `` The club is n't the best place to find a lover , so the bar is where I go / Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow '' , he sings . `` Come over and start up a conversation with just me / And trust me I 'll give it a chance . '' According to NT News , the song `` tells the story of loved ( or lusted ) up Sheeran meeting a girl in a bar where he and his mates are doing shots . '' `` Shape of You '' is written in the key of C ♯ minor with a tempo of 96 beats per minute . The song is composed in common time ( time ) , and follows a basic chord progression of C ♯ m -- F ♯ m -- A -- B ( i -- iv -- VI -- VII ) , and Sheeran 's vocals span from G ♯ to G ♯ . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) `` ( ' Shape of You ' ) is actually a really random one because I went in to write songs for other people with a guy called Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid , and we were writing this song and I was like ' this would really work for Rihanna , ' '' he explained . `` And then I started singing lyrics like ' putting Van The Man on the jukebox ' and I was like ' well she 's not really going to sing that , is she ? ' And then we sort of decided halfway through that we were just going to make it for me . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "8) On 4 January 2017 , Sheeran uploaded a six - second teaser video of a blue background to social media , with lyrics `` the club is n't the best place to find a lover '' , which is the first line of `` Shape of You '' . To further tease the release , Sheeran and his label used a sponsored Snapchat lens filter with 30 seconds on the song to increase buzz among the general public . \n",

      "\n",
      "10) In the United States , `` Shape of You '' has immediately become a favorite among DJs and remixers , prompting several of them to create their own versions . One DJ , Joe `` Maz '' Masurka , told Billboard that after he did his own remix on the single that he received a lot of great feedback and response : `` I absolutely love the track , so I had to remix it myself so that I could play it in all my live shows . Ed is a genius ; best song in the last few years . I 've been playing it literally everywhere I 've been booked since about mid-January : Hyde Bellagio in Las Vegas , E11even and Ora in Miami , Parq in San Diego , Premier Atlantic City ... the dance floor loves it . '' A Latin remix featuring reggaeton duo Zion & Lennox was released on 17 March 2017 . Sheeran and American rapper Lil Uzi Vert performed a live remix of `` Shape Of You '' during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards , followed by a rendition of Lil Uzi Vert 's song `` XO Tour Llif3 '' . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> In the early 1960s , the Nashville sound began to be challenged by the rival Bakersfield sound on the country side and by the British Invasion on the pop side ; compounding these problems were the sudden deaths , in separate airplane crashes , of Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves , two of the Nashville Sound 's biggest stars . Nashville 's pop song structure became more pronounced and it morphed into what was called Countrypolitan - a smoother sound typified through the use of lush string arrangements with a real orchestra and often , background vocals provided by a choir . Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s . Among the architects of this sound were producers Billy Sherrill ( who was instrumental in shaping Tammy Wynette 's early career ) and Glenn Sutton . Artists who typified the countrypolitan sound initially included Wynette , Glen Campbell ( who recorded in Hollywood and not Nashville ) , Lynn Anderson , Charlie Rich , and Charley Pride , the latter being a rare example of a top - selling African - American country performer . </P>\n",

Other observers have identified several recordings that helped establish the early Nashville sound . Country historian Rich Kienzle says that `` Gone '' , a Ferlin Husky hit recorded in November 1956 , `` may well have pointed the way to the Nashville sound . '' Writer Colin Escott proclaims Jim Reeves ' `` Four Walls '' , recorded February 1957 , to be the `` first ' Nashville sound ' record '' , and Chet Atkins , the RCA - based producer and guitarist most often credited with being the sound 's primary artistic brainchild , pointed to his production of Don Gibson 's `` Oh Lonesome Me '' late that same year . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) In the early 1960s , the Nashville sound began to be challenged by the rival Bakersfield sound on the country side and by the British Invasion on the pop side ; compounding these problems were the sudden deaths , in separate airplane crashes , of Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves , two of the Nashville Sound 's biggest stars . Nashville 's pop song structure became more pronounced and it morphed into what was called Countrypolitan - a smoother sound typified through the use of lush string arrangements with a real orchestra and often , background vocals provided by a choir . Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s . Among the architects of this sound were producers Billy Sherrill ( who was instrumental in shaping Tammy Wynette 's early career ) and Glenn Sutton . Artists who typified the countrypolitan sound initially included Wynette , Glen Campbell ( who recorded in Hollywood and not Nashville ) , Lynn Anderson , Charlie Rich , and Charley Pride , the latter being a rare example of a top - selling African - American country performer . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music , replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with `` smooth strings and choruses '' , `` sophisticated background vocals '' and `` smooth tempos '' . It was an attempt `` to revive country sales , which had been devastated by the rise of rock ' n ' roll . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Bakersfield sound , and later outlaw country , dominated country music among aficionados while countrypolitan reigned on the pop charts . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) By the late 1970s and 1980s , many pop music singers picked up the countrypolitan style and created what is known as country pop , the fusion of country music and soft rock . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The Nashville sound was pioneered by staff at Decca Records , RCA Records and Columbia Records in Nashville , Tennessee , including manager Steve Sholes , record producers Chet Atkins , Owen Bradley , and Bob Ferguson , and recording engineer Bill Porter . They invented the form by replacing elements of the popular honky tonk style ( fiddles , steel guitar , nasal lead vocals ) with `` smooth '' elements from 1950s pop music ( string sections , background vocals , crooning lead vocals ) , and using `` slick '' production , and pop music structures . The producers relied on a small group of studio musicians known as the Nashville A-Team , whose quick adaptability and creative input made them vital to the hit - making process . The Anita Kerr Quartet was the main vocal backing group in the early 1960s . In 1960 , Time magazine reported that Nashville had `` nosed out Hollywood as the nation 's second biggest ( after New York ) record - producing center . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In an essay published in Heartaches by the Number : Country Music 's 500 Greatest Singles , David Cantwell argues that Elvis Presley 's rock and roll recording of `` Do n't Be Cruel '' in July 1956 was the record that sparked the beginning of the era now called the Nashville sound . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Upon being asked what the Nashville sound was , Chet Atkins would put his hand into his pocket , shake his loose change , and say `` That 's what it is . It 's the sound of money '' . \n",

      "1)The New Atlantis ( journal ) - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The journal 's name is taken from Francis Bacon 's utopian novella New Atlantis , which the journal 's editors describe as a `` fable of a society living with the benefits and challenges of advanced science and technology . '' An editorial in the inaugural issue states that the aim of the journal is `` to help us avoid the extremes of euphoria and despair that new technologies too often arouse ; and to help us judge when mobilizing our technological prowess is sensible or necessary , and when the preservation of things that count requires limiting the kinds of technological power that would lessen , cheapen , or ultimately destroy us . '' Writing for National Review , editor Adam Keiper described The New Atlantis as being written from a `` particularly American and conservative way of thinking about both the blessings and the burdens of modern science and technology . '' New Atlantis authors and bioethicists publishing in other journals have also similarly referred to The New Atlantis as being written from a social conservative stance which utilizes religion . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The New Atlantis also publishes a book series , New Atlantis Books , an imprint of Encounter Books . To date , six books have been released : \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Writing for the National Review in a 2003 column , the conservative author Stanley Kurtz described The New Atlantis as influential on thinking about science and technology . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Richard John Neuhaus , late editor of the conservative journal First Things , wrote that The New Atlantis is `` as good a publication as there is for the intelligent exploration of questions in bioethics and projections -- promising , ominous , and fantastical -- about the human future , '' and a writer in The American Conservative described the journal as a source `` of fresh ideas on the Right . '' National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg described The New Atlantis as `` a new and interesting magazine '' that `` seems to be trying to carve out the space for the government to stop the more offensive aspects of biotechnology . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The journal has also published widely on the interpersonal effects of the Internet and digital technology . It has featured articles on subjects like Facebook , cell phones , multitasking , e-readers , GPS and navigation , and virtual reality . A 2006 article by Matthew B. Crawford advocating the intellectual and economic virtues of the manual trades was noted as a best - of - the - year essay by New York Times columnist David Brooks , and was subsequently expanded into the bestselling book Shop Class as Soulcraft . The journal also frequently publishes essays on philosophical and literary questions relating to science and technology . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The New Atlantis tends to publish views in favor of technological innovation but wary of certain avenues of development . For example , the journal has generally advocated nuclear energy ; space exploration and development through public - private partnerships , including manned missions to Mars ; biofuels ; and genetically modified foods . But it has expressed ambivalent or critical views about developments in synthetic biology and military technologies like drones , chemical weapons , and cyberwarfare . Articles often explore policy questions on these and other issues , sometimes advocating particular policy outcomes , especially on health care , environmental management , and energy . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The journal also features broader philosophical reflections on science and technology , and tends to be skeptical of what its authors consider to be speculative overreach common in popular discussions . Examples include articles that have defended the existence of free will in light of developments in neuroscience , questioned the wisdom of using brain scans in courtrooms , and described how growing knowledge of epigenetics has undermined common claims about genetic determinism . While the journal has sometimes aired libertarian views about human enhancement and transhumanism , its contributors generally tend to question whether technologies like artificial intelligence , `` friendly '' artificial intelligence , and genetic enhancement are possible or desirable . The journal also publishes the Futurisms blog , dedicated to criticizing transhumanism . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The New Atlantis , founded in 2003 , is a quarterly journal about the social , ethical , political , and policy dimensions of modern science and technology . The journal is published in Washington , D.C. by the social conservative advocacy group the Ethics and Public Policy Center in partnership with the Center for the Study of Technology and Society . It is edited by Ari Schulman , having previously been edited by co-founders Eric Cohen and Adam Keiper . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The journal has particularly gained a reputation among the transhumanist movement for its criticism of human enhancement . James Hughes , a techno - progressivist and at times director of organizations such as the World Transhumanist Association and the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies , notes that the journal `` has published influential attacks on artificial intelligence , nanotechnology , biotechnology , reproductive technology , and life extension . '' Natasha Vita - More has described it as a `` journal known as a ring of bioconservatives bent on opposing the cyberculture , '' while the Extropy Institute has called it `` a high - powered rallying point for the neo-Luddites .

      "\n",
      "4) British author Deborah Cadbury wrote Seven Wonders of the Industrial World , a book telling the stories of seven great feats of engineering of the 19th and early 20th centuries .

      "\n",
      "6) In the 19th and early 20th centuries , some writers wrote their own lists with names such as Wonders of the Middle Ages , Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages , Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind , and Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages . However , it is unlikely that these lists originated in the Middle Ages , because the word `` medieval '' was not invented until the Enlightenment - era , and the concept of a Middle Age did not become popular until the 16th century . Brewer 's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable refers to them as `` later list ( s ) '' , suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The only ancient world wonder that still exists is the Great Pyramid of Giza . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In 1994 , the American Society of Civil Engineers compiled a list of Seven Wonders of the Modern World , paying tribute to the `` greatest civil engineering achievements of the 20th century '' . \n",

      "\n",
      "2) `` The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' is a special issue published by the American magazine Rolling Stone in two parts in 2004 and 2005 , and updated in 2011 . The list presented was compiled based on input from musicians , writers , and industry figures , and is focused on the rock & roll era . It predominantly features American and British musicians . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) In both versions of the list , the top three positions are held by The Beatles , Bob Dylan and Elvis Presley . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The list , published in two issues in 2004 and 2005 and updated in 2011 , was based on the choices of a panel of 55 musicians , writers , and industry figures . As the editors explain , the artists were selected by `` their peers '' , and the list aims to be `` a broad survey of rock history '' , spanning from rock and roll , blues , indie rock , rap music and contemporary pop music . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Most artists on the list were active in the 1960s and 1970s . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The list consists primarily of American or British artists , with following exceptions : AC / DC ( Australia ) , Bob Marley ( Jamaica ) , Joni Mitchell ( Canada ) , Lee `` Scratch '' Perry ( Jamaica ; only in the 2005 list ) , Carlos Santana ( Mexico / US ) , U2 ( Ireland ) , and Neil Young ( Canada ) . Tina Turner , who relinquished her American citizenship after obtaining Swiss citizenship in 2013 , was still an American citizen when included in the list . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In 2011 , Rolling Stone published a revised edition of the list , with changes from 27th position onwards . The updated list features artists not present in the original ( including Queen , Metallica , Pink Floyd , Talking Heads , R.E.M. , Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers , and Jay - Z ) , removing a number of other artists ( including Etta James , Miles Davis , Roxy Music , N.W.A. , and Martha & The Vandellas ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The publication also features comments written by musicians about their favorite colleagues ( e.g. , Elvis Costello on The Beatles , Janet Jackson on Tina Turner , etc . ) . Since its publication , the list has been frequently cited by many specialized and generalist publications . \n",

While there is no rule prohibiting the screening of the other 3 : 00pm games in Ireland , the Premier League does not make the rights to these games available to Irish broadcasters , due to the overlap in reception that is possible in Northern Ireland and mainland England and not 's total match completely absolute live in total all interviews season the paradox that total matches live other will only be seen on streaming sites of he Premier League TV . \n",

Having a driver 's permit for a certain length of time is usually one of the requirements ( along with driver 's education and a road test ) for applying for a full driver 's license . To get a learner 's permit , one must typically pass a written permit test , traffic , and rules of the road . \n",

      "\n",
      "3) In many states the period of driving on a learner 's permit is shortened if the applicant is above the age of eighteen . For example , in Oklahoma if a driver is 18 or older a learner 's permit must only be held for one month before the driver qualifies for an intermediate license . Some states allow drivers over the age of twenty - one to bypass the entire graduated licensing process . For example , in Colorado , a driver over the age of twenty - one may apply for and pass the tests for a permit and a full driver 's license on the same day and , if successful in passing the tests , may obtain a full driver 's license as soon as the driver passes a scheduled driving test . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Learner 's Licence exam is a 68 question multiple choice exam with questions spread over three sections : Rules of the road ( 30 questions ) ; Signs , signals and road markings ( 30 questions ) , and vehicle controls ( 8 questions ) . The holder of a learner 's licence is allowed to drive only when supervised by a licensed driver . If the category of vehicle being driven requires a professional driving permit , the licensed driver must also hold a professional driving permit . South African Learners must carry their Learner 's Licence with them whenever they are driving a vehicle and have L plates on the rear window . The Learner 's Licence is valid for 24 months . \n",

      "6) In India , the minimum age at which a provisional licence is valid is 18 ( and 16 for riding a gear less scooter ) . When driving under a provisional license , the learner must be accompanied by a driver who holds a full driving license . The supervisor has to be in view of the road and be in a position to control the vehicle . The provisional license is available only after passing the theory test . A full licence can be acquired only after passing the driving test . Once the learner has passed the theory test , they may take the practical driving test . Once the practical driving test has been taken and passed , a full driving licence will be automatically issued . While it is possible to take both tests immediately after each other , most learner drivers take a period between taking the theory and applying for a practical test to carry out driving lessons , either with their supervisor or a professional Driving school . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) An intermediate or provisional license allows the driver to drive a vehicle without supervision by a licensed driver . Driving is typically permitted during a limited range of mostly daylight hours , as well as to and from school , work and religious activities . Some states may require a road test before allowing a learner 's permit holder to obtain an intermediate license . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) After a legally defined period of driving supervised with a permit , usually between six and twelve months , and upon reaching the requisite age , the holder of a learner 's permit can apply for a provisional license . Obtaining a provisional license allows certain restrictions to be lifted from the driver , such as the times that they are allowed to drive , and the number of people allowed in the car . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In South Africa , any person who is of the minimum required age and holds a valid ID document may sit a learner 's licence exam . The minimum required age varies by vehicle class and has the following minimum age restrictions : \n",

      "10) In some states , permit holders are allowed to drive to and from school or work with a permit , without a supervising driver . In Indiana , Iowa , Texas , Rhode Island , Maryland and Kentucky , a permit holder between 17 and 18 may legally drive unaccompanied only if heading to work or to school . \n",

It ended up debuting to just $2.6 million , finishing 12th at the box office and marking the lowest opening of the series . Deadline Hollywood noted the film suffered from being the third film of a trilogy and also said religious audiences saw the film as `` a cash grab and not a movie promoting a Christian message anymore '' , and were more inclined to go to other faith - based films in theaters like I Can Only Imagine and Paul , Apostle of Christ . It fell 58 % in its second weekend to $1.1 million , finishing 17th . By the end of its North American run the film grossed a total of $5.5 million , less than other two films grossed simply in their opening weekends ( $9.7 million and $7.6 million , respectively ) . \n",

      "1)I Love It ( Icona Pop song ) - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The song 's lyrics describe breaking up with an older boyfriend . In its chorus , Icona Pop and Charli XCX shout in unison `` I do n't care / I love it '' . Critics compared the song 's breakup narrative to Kelly Clarkson 's 2004 single `` Since U Been Gone '' , and journalist Chuck Eddy wrote in a piece for Spin that the track 's brattiness was similar to British band Shampoo . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) `` I Love It '' is a song by Swedish DJ duo Icona Pop featuring vocals from British recording artist Charli XCX . It was released in May 2012 as a digital download in Sweden , where it peaked at number two on the singles chart . The song was added to their debut studio album , Icona Pop , as well as their EP Iconic and their debut international album , This Is ... Icona Pop . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The song was originally written by Charli XCX , whom Icona Pop met several times in London . Swedish producer Patrik Berger sent Charli two beats , and she quickly wrote songs for each of them , one of which became `` I Love It '' and the other of which became her following single `` You 're the One '' . However , she later stated that she knew she would not end up releasing it herself because she could not reconcile it with her sound . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) `` I Love It '' was met with positive reviews from music critics . The song placed 15th on The Village Voice 's 2012 Pazz & Jop list , and it rose to eighth place the following year . Pitchfork Media labeled it `` Best New Music '' , calling the song `` delectable , empowering , infinitely repeatable '' . Pitchfork later listed the song number 50 on its `` Top 100 Tracks of 2012 '' list . Rolling Stone placed `` I Love It '' at number 35 on its year - end list , naming it `` the Euro - slut club jam of the summer '' . Amrit Singh for Stereogum described it as `` fun '' , Heather Phares commented Jawo and Hjelt `` half - sung , half - shouted vocals and revved - up synths make the song inescapably catchy '' . Kat Bein of the Miami New Times called the song a `` feminist pop anthem '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In June 2013 , several cover versions of the song entered the UK Singles Chart , including one by vlogger Venus Angelic . When Icona Pop released their version , it entered at the top of the chart , overtaking Robin Thicke 's `` Blurred Lines '' featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams . \n",

It is written in A ♭ major , with an authentic cadence for the main chord progression . Billboard critic Jessica Hopper defined the instrumental by its `` swells of revving synths '' and prominent sub-bass sounds . Pitchfork writer Lindsay Zoladz commented that the song was `` basically just two - and - a-half minutes of drop '' ; colleague Larry Fitzmaurice noted the track 's maximalist approach fit the contemporary trends in electronic and pop music . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) While recording `` Good for You '' with Icona Pop , Berger presented them with Charli 's work on `` I Love It '' . Band member Aino Jawo said she felt a connection to the song because it mirrored her own experiences , and the line `` You 're from the 70s but I 'm a 90s bitch '' reminded her of an older man she had known . Member Caroline Hjelt described Charli XCX 's original demo as `` more cute , in a way ... really cool and cocky '' . Icona Pop approached Swedish producer Style of Eye to make a rougher version of the track , telling him , `` We want the punkiness . We want the ' fuck it ' feeling . '' \n",

      "10) The song received positive reviews from music critics , and publications Rolling Stone and Pitchfork included it on their year - end lists for 2012 .

      "1)United States courts of appeals - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The United States courts of appeals or circuit courts are the intermediate appellate courts of the United States federal court system . A court of appeals decides appeals from the district courts within its federal judicial circuit , and in some instances from other designated federal courts and administrative agencies . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Many decades ago , certain classes of federal court cases held the right of an automatic appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States . That is , one of the parties in the case could appeal a decision of a court of appeals to the Supreme Court , and it had to accept the case . The right of automatic appeal for most types of decisions of a court of appeals was ended by an Act of Congress , the Judiciary Act of 1925 . This law was urged by Chief Justice William Howard Taft , and it also reorganized many other things in the federal court system . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Judiciary Act of 1789 established three circuits , which were groups of judicial districts in which United States circuit courts were established . Each circuit court consisted of two Supreme Court justices and the local district judge ; the three circuits existed solely for the purpose of assigning the justices to a group of circuit courts . Some districts ( generally the ones most difficult for an itinerant justice to reach ) did not have a circuit court ; in these districts the district court exercised the original jurisdiction of a circuit court . As new states were admitted to the Union , Congress often did not create circuit courts for them for a number of years . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) When the courts of appeals were created in 1891 , one was created for each of the nine circuits then existing , and each court was named the `` United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the _____ Circuit '' . When a court of appeals was created for the District of Columbia in 1893 , it was named the `` Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia '' , and it was renamed to the `` United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia '' in 1934 . In 1948 , Congress renamed all of the courts of appeals then existing to their current formal names : the court of appeals for each numbered circuit was named the `` United States Court of Appeals for the _____ Circuit '' , and the `` United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia '' became the `` United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit '' . The Tenth Circuit was created in 1929 by subdividing the existing Eighth Circuit , and the Eleventh Circuit was created in 1981 by subdividing the existing Fifth Circuit . The Federal Circuit was created in 1982 by the merger of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate division of the United States Court of Claims . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Because the courts of appeals possess only appellate jurisdiction , they do not hold trials . Only courts with original jurisdiction hold trials and thus determine punishments ( in criminal cases ) and remedies ( in civil cases ) . Instead , appeals courts review decisions of trial courts for errors of law . Accordingly , an appeals court considers only the record ( that is , the papers the parties filed and the transcripts and any exhibits from any trial ) from the trial court , and the legal arguments of the parties . These arguments , which are presented in written form and can range in length from dozens to hundreds of pages , are known as briefs . Sometimes lawyers are permitted to add to their written briefs with oral arguments before the appeals judges . At such hearings , only the parties ' lawyers speak to the court . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Courts of appeals decisions , unlike those of the lower federal courts , establish binding precedents . Other federal courts in that circuit must , from that point forward , follow the appeals court 's guidance in similar cases , regardless of whether the trial judge thinks that the case should be decided differently . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) A court of appeals may convene a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel to hear appeals in bankruptcy cases directly from the bankruptcy court of its circuit . As of 2008 , only the First , Sixth , Eighth , Ninth , and Tenth Circuits have established a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel . Those circuits that do not have a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel have their bankruptcy appeals heard by the District Court . \n",

      "\n",
      "2) Van Helsing later describes the aftermath of a bitten victim when the vampire has been killed : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Victims who are bitten by a vampire and do not die , are hypnotically influenced by them : \n",
      "\n",
      "4) One of Dracula 's most mysterious powers is the ability to turn others into vampires by biting them . According to Van Helsing : \n",
      "\n",
      "5) While having a conversation with Jonathan Harker in Chapter 3 , Dracula refers to his own background , and these speeches show elements which Stoker directly copied from Wilkinson 's book . Stoker mentions the Voivode of the Dracula race who fought against the Turks after the defeat in the Battle of Kosovo , and was later betrayed by his brother , historical facts which unequivocally point to Vlad III , described as `` Voïvode Dracula '' by Wilkinson : \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The vampire bite itself does not cause death . It is the method vampires use to drain blood of the victim and to increase their influence over them . This is described by Van Helsing : \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Stoker came across the name Dracula in his reading on Romanian history , and chose this to replace the name ( Count Wampyr ) that he had originally intended to use for his villain . However , some Dracula scholars , led by Elizabeth Miller , have questioned the depth of this connection as early as 1998 . They argue that Stoker in fact knew little of the historic Vlad III , Vlad the Impaler and that he used only the name `` Dracula '' and some miscellaneous scraps of Romanian history . As well , and there are no comments about Vlad III in the author 's working notes . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The party pries open each of the graves , places wafers of Sacramental bread within each of them , and seals them shut . This deprives the Count of his ability to seek safety in those boxes . Dracula gains entry into Seward 's residence by coercing an invitation out of Renfield . As he attempts to enter the room in which Harker and Mina are staying , Renfield tries to stop him ; Dracula then mortally wounds him . With his dying breath , Renfield tells Seward and Van Helsing that Dracula is after Mina. Van Helsing and Seward discover Dracula biting Mina then forcing her to drink his blood . The group repel Dracula using crucifixes and sacramental bread , forcing Dracula to flee by turning into a dark vapor . The party continue to hunt Dracula to search for his remaining lairs . Although Dracula 's ' baptism ' of Mina grants him a telepathic link to her , it backfires when Van Helsing hypnotizes Mina and uses her supernatural link with Dracula to track him as he flees back to Transylvania . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Already in 1958 , Cecil Kirtly proposed that Count Dracula shared his personal past with the historical Transylvanian - born Voivode Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia , also known as Vlad the Impaler or Vlad Țepeș . Following the publication of In Search of Dracula by Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally in 1972 , this supposed connection attracted much popular attention . This work argued that Bram Stoker based his Dracula on Vlad the Impaler . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Dracula 's preferred victims are women . Harker states that he believes Dracula has a state of fasting as well as a state of feeding . Dracula does state to Mina however that exerting his abilities caused a desire to feed . \n",

      "1) Sir Andrew Maxwell `` Andy '' Dwyer KBE / ˈdwaɪ. ər / is a fictional character in the NBC comedy Parks and Recreation portrayed by Chris Pratt . Originally meant to be a temporary character , Andy was so likable that producers asked Pratt back as a series regular . He appears in the first season as Ann Perkins ' unemployed slacker boyfriend , then takes a job as a shoe - shiner at Pawnee City Hall in the second season . Andy eventually marries April Ludgate and is later promoted to Leslie Knope 's assistant . Pratt was credited as a guest star for the first season , despite appearing in every episode ; he is part of the main cast for every season after season one . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Chris Pratt was credited as a guest star throughout the entire first season , but was promoted to the main cast in the second season .

      "\n",
      "5) At the beginning of season four , Tom asks Andy to join his new company . He declines Tom 's offer and instead joins Leslie 's campaign as her assistant and head of security , a role he enjoys very much . At the end of the season , he is encouraged by April to pursue a career as a police officer as all his `` dream jobs , '' with the exception of rock star , revolve around law enforcement . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) At the start of the series , Andy Dwyer is dating Ann Perkins . Ann matured faster than Andy did ; while Ann entered into a career in nursing , Andy remained lazy and spoiled . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Andy 's role is reduced in the sixth season , as Chris Pratt was busy with other filming commitments . Andy spends the early part of season 6 in England attending to Sweetum 's charity work . Before he went to England , he loses 50 pounds after giving up beer . He briefly visits Pawnee and does not want to return to England , but April convinces him to go back . In the season finale , Andy reunites with MouseRat and sings a Li'l Sebastian memorial song at the Pawnee Unity concert . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Andy has been unsuccessfully trying to get in touch with April . When she finally returns from Venezuela , she arrives with a new boyfriend , Eduardo . Leslie encourages Andy to not give up . In the episode `` Time Capsule '' , Andy befriends Eduardo at the advice of Chris Traeger . As a result , April begins hating her new boyfriend , and he moves back to Venezuela . Andy also becomes the new coach of one of the two youth basketball teams , with Ron serving as the other coach . Andy 's coaching style is much lazier than Ron 's strict style . He is also briefly Ron 's receptionist in `` Flu Season '' . In the episode `` Media Blitz '' , April leads Andy to believe that if he completes the tasks she hates every day for a month , she will consider being with him . Although she begins this as a bluff , after seeing Andy complete even the most humiliating of these tasks happily , she kisses him . In the episode `` Andy and April 's Fancy Party '' Andy reveals that he had proposed to April a day earlier after only one month of dating to which April replied , `` Fine . '' They are married at the end of the episode in a surprise ceremony . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In the second season , Pratt did a scene with Amy Poehler while he was naked . Poehler was not expecting this and Pratt was reprimanded for it . The take was later aired on TV . He was expected to wear skin tone briefs . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Andy moves into a tent pitched in the pit and watches Ann , claiming to be protecting her . He makes many failed attempts to reconcile with Ann . After Mark Brendanawicz begins dating Ann , Andy grows to hate him , but pretends to like him whenever Ann is around . Andy is injured in the pit a second time when Leslie arranges to have it filled with dirt , unaware that Andy is still in the pit . Andy considers suing the town with the hopes of getting money and winning Ann back , but Leslie convinces him to settle out of court in exchange for having the pit filled in . Leslie gives Andy a job as the shoe - shiner at the Pawnee City Hall as part of his settlement . April Ludgate , the parks department intern , begins to develop a crush on Andy , but he is for a long time unaware of her feelings toward him . As time goes on , Andy begins to develop feelings for April , though he is unsure about dating her due to their age difference and his own unresolved feelings for Ann . Simultaneously , Ann begins to show similar feelings for Andy after her relationship with Mark ends . At the end of the season , having broken up with Mark , Ann kisses Andy , who does not reciprocate . This later causes him problems with April , who continues to believe he is still in love with Ann . \n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> Drawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10 : 59 p.m. Eastern Time . Since October 7 , 2015 , the game has used a 5 / 69 ( white balls ) + 1 / 26 ( Powerballs ) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen , resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play . Each play costs $2 , or $3 with the Power Play option . ( Originally , Powerball plays cost $1 ; when PowerPlay began , such games were $2 . ) The official cutoff for ticket sales is 10 : 00 p.m. Eastern Time ; some lotteries cut off sales earlier . The drawings are usually held at the Florida Lottery 's studio in Tallahassee . </P>\n",

      "\n",
      "2) The New York Lottery introduced a Powerball scratchcard in 2010 . Five winning numbers plus a powerball were printed across the top of the card , with 12 opportunities to match . Matching the winning numbers or the powerball won . The top prize was $1 million ( annuity ) ; unlike actual Powerball , there was no cash option for the top prize . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) On June 2 , 2010 , Ohio won a Powerball jackpot ; it became the first lottery selling either Mega Millions or Powerball ( when 2010 began ) to provide a jackpot - winning ticket for its newer game . The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity ; it was sold in Sunbury . Ohio 's second Powerball jackpot - winning ticket , sold for the June 23 , 2010 drawing , was part of another first ; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing , it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion , as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) On January 13 , 2016 , Powerball produced the largest lottery jackpot in history ; the $1.586 billion jackpot was split by three tickets sold in Chino Hills , California , in Munford , Tennessee , and in Melbourne Beach , Florida . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Powerball 's predecessor began in 1988 ; the multi-state game was known as Lotto * America . The game , and name , were changed to Powerball on April 19 , 1992 ; its first drawing was held April 22 . \n",

      "\n",
      "7) Illinois joining Powerball on the expansion date , it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game ( after Mega Millions , which Illinois already participated in ) whose drawings were carried nationally . Both games ' drawings were simulcast via Chicago cable superstation WGN - TV through its national WGN America feed . WGN - TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago 's Fox owned - and - operated station WFLD in 1988 , which took the rights from WGN - TV in 1987 . Powerball drawings were aired on WGN - TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station 's 9pm ( Central Time ) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast . WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery 's drawings . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In March 2009 , it was reported that New Jersey , already a Mega Millions member , sought permission to join Powerball . Shortly after , discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games . On Oct 13 , the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball . In Nov , MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Alabama , Alaska , Hawaii , Mississippi , Nevada and Utah do not sell lottery tickets . In 2013 , Wyoming became the 44th state to establish a lottery ; the next year , it began , initially offering both Mega Millions and Powerball . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) When the Powerball jackpot is won , the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million ( annuity ) . If a jackpot is not won , the minimum rollover is $10 million . The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity . If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations , game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage ; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings . \n",

      "3) Dubai ( / duːˈbaɪ / doo - BY ; Arabic : دبي ‎ Dubay , Gulf pronunciation : ( dʊˈbɑj ) ) is the largest and most populous city in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) . It is located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf and is the capital of the Emirate of Dubai , one of the seven emirates that make up the country . Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country 's Federal Supreme Council . The city of Dubai is located on the emirate 's northern coastline and heads the Dubai - Sharjah - Ajman metropolitan area . Dubai will host World Expo 2020 . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western Hajar Mountains , which run alongside Dubai 's border with Oman at Hatta . The Western Hajar chain has an arid , jagged and shattered landscape , whose mountains rise to about 1,300 metres ( 4,265 feet ) in some places . Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases ; however , Dubai does have a natural inlet , Dubai Creek , which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through . Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes , which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains . A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai and eventually leads into the desert known as The Empty Quarter . Seismically , Dubai is in a very stable zone -- the nearest seismic fault line , the Zagros Fault , is 200 kilometres ( 124 miles ) from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai . Experts also predict that the possibility of a tsunami in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Dubai Creek runs northeast - southwest through the city . The eastern section of the city forms the locality of Deira and is flanked by the emirate of Sharjah in the east and the town of Al Aweer in the south . The Dubai International Airport is located south of Deira , while the Palm Deira is located north of Deira in the Persian Gulf . Much of Dubai 's real - estate boom is concentrated to the west of Dubai Creek , on the Jumeirah coastal belt . Port Rashid , Jebel Ali , Burj Al Arab , the Palm Jumeirah and theme - based free - zone clusters such as Business Bay are all located in this section . Dubai is notable for sculpted artificial island complexes including the Palm Islands and The World archipelago . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Dubai has been called the `` shopping capital of the Middle East '' . Dubai alone has more than 70 shopping centres , including the world 's largest shopping centre , Dubai Mall . Dubai is also known for the traditional souk districts located on either side of its creek . Traditionally , dhows from East Asia , China , Sri Lanka , and India would discharge their cargo and the goods would be bargained over in the souks adjacent to the docks . Dubai Creek played a vital role in sustaining the life of the community in the city and was the resource which originally drove the economic boom in Dubai . As of September 2013 , Dubai creek has been proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Many boutiques and jewellery stores are also found in the city . Dubai is also referred to as `` the City of Gold '' as the Gold Souk in Deira houses nearly 250 gold retail shops . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In 1973 , Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency : the UAE dirham . In that same year , the prior monetary union with Qatar was dissolved and the UAE Dirham was introduced throughout the Emirates . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Football and cricket are the most popular sports in Dubai . Five teams ( Al Wasl FC , Al - Ahli Dubai , Al Nasr SC , Al Shabab Al Arabi Club and Dubai Club ) represent Dubai in UAE Pro-League . Al - Wasl have the second-most number of championships in the UAE League , after Al Ain . Dubai also hosts both the annual Dubai Tennis Championships and The Legends Rock Dubai tennis tournaments , as well as the Dubai Desert Classic golf tournament and the Dubai World Championship , all of which attract sports stars from around the world . The Dubai World Cup , a thoroughbred horse race , is held annually at the Meydan Racecourse . Dubai also hosts the traditional rugby union tournament Dubai Sevens , part of the Sevens World Series Event pictures of Rugby 7 Dubai 2015 . In 2009 , Dubai hosted the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens . Auto racing is also a big sport in Dubai , the Dubai Autodrome is home to many auto racing events throughout the year . It also features a state - of - the - art indoor and outdoor Kartdrome , popular among racing enthusiasts and recreational riders . \n",

      "9) The most well - known universities in Dubai are American University in Dubai , Hult International Business School , Al Ghurair University , The American College of Dubai , University of Wollongong in Dubai , British University in Dubai offering courses in Business Administration , Engineering , Architecture and Interior Design . American University in Dubai is one of the six UAE universities featured in QS World University Rankings 2014 / 2015 . In 2013 Synergy University Dubai Campus opened its campus in Jumeirah Lakes Towers being a first University in Dubai to be located outside of Educational Zones ( Knowledge Village or Academic City ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Many theories have been proposed as to the origin of the word `` Dubai '' . One theory suggests the word was used to describe the souq , which was similar to the souq in Ba . An Arabic proverb says `` Daba Dubai '' ( Arabic : دبا دبي ‎ ) , meaning `` They came with a lot of money . '' According to Fedel Handhal , a scholar on the UAE 's history and culture , the word Dubai may have come from the word daba ( Arabic : دبا ‎ ) ( a past tense derivative of yadub ( Arabic : يدب ‎ ) , which means `` to creep '' ) , referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland . The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word , but to its alternative meaning of `` baby locust '' ( Arabic : جراد ‎ ) due to the abundant nature of locusts in the area before settlement . An inhabitant or native of the city is a Dubaian . \n",

      "1)All that is gold does not glitter - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The early versions of the poem are recorded in The Treason of Isengard , part of The History of Middle - earth book series by Christopher Tolkien . The first draft of the poem , which at that stage of composition was the only content of Gandalf 's letter , reads : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Older editions of The Lord of the Rings indexed the poem as `` The Riddle of Strider '' . From the 50th anniversary edition of 2005 on , the new , enlarged index by Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull list it as `` All that is gold does not glitter '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The lines were changed in stages , with many experimental forms rejected . Christopher Tolkien also suggested that `` the Sword that was Broken ( Narsil ) actually emerged from the verse ' All that is gold does not glitter ' : on this view , in ( the last version cited above ) the words a king may yet be without crown , A blade that was broken be brandished were no more than a further exemplification of the general moral . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The poem appears twice in The Fellowship of the Ring , the first volume of The Lord of the Rings . It appears first in Chapter Ten , `` Strider '' , in Gandalf 's letter to Frodo Baggins in Bree , although when Frodo reads it he does not realize that Strider ( Aragorn ) is the subject of the verse . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The verse is repeated by Bilbo at the Council of Elrond . He whispers to Frodo that he wrote it many years before , when Aragorn first revealed who he was . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) `` All That is Gold Does Not Glitter '' ( alternatively known as `` The Riddle of Strider '' or `` Song of Aragorn '' ) is a poem written by J.R.R. Tolkien for his fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings . It alludes to an integral part of the plot , and describes Aragorn , son of Arathorn . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In Peter Jackson 's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings for film , the poem appears in The Return of the King , when Arwen recites the last four lines of the poem as her father Elrond prepares to reforge the shards of Narsil for Aragorn . In the 1981 BBC radio dramatisation , the entire poem is heard in its original context , the letter left at Bree by Gandalf . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The way appearance displays reality in our world is largely inverted in Middle - earth with respect to the subject matter of the poem . The first line is a variant and rearrangement of the proverb `` All that glitters is not gold '' , known primarily from Shakespeare 's The Merchant of Venice , resulting in a proposition bearing a completely different meaning : Aragorn is vastly more important than he looks . The second line emphasizes the importance of the Rangers , suspiciously viewed as wanderers or vagabonds by those the Rangers actually protect from evil . Lines three and four emphasize the endurance of Aragorn 's royal lineage , while five and six emphasizes its renewal . They can also be seen to represent a spark of hope during a time of despair and danger . Line seven refers to the sword Narsil . Line eight foreshadows the crownless Aragorn 's accession to the throne of both the kingless Gondor and the vanished Arnor . \n",

      "\n",
      "3) Gun laws in the state of Georgia regulate the sale , possession , and use of firearms and ammunition in the state of Georgia in the United States . It does not however affect the laws of other states . The Georgia Constitution , like many other state constitutions , guarantees to its citizen the right to keep and bear arms . Article one , section one , paragraph VII of the Georgia Constitution states : `` The right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed , but the General Assembly shall have the power to prescribe the manner in which arms may be borne .

      "\n",
      "5) In 2017 , the Georgia legislature passed HB 280 , which allows for concealed carry permit holders to carry concealed handguns on public college campuses . Governor Nathan Deal signed it into law on May 4 , 2017 . The law took effect July 1 , 2017 on all University System of Georgia Campuses , including universities , colleges , and trade schools under the University System . Under HB280 any Georgia Weapons Licensee may carry on University System of Georgia property if they are carrying concealed . They may not carry in any dormitory or Greek house owned by the University System , in any athletic venue used for intercollegiate sports , in any daycare facility on campus with limited entry ( gated ) , in any classroom with a currently enrolled high school student , in any private office space , or in any room currently in use for disciplinary proceedings . HB280 does not remove the prohibition against carry on private university and college property under Georgia Law . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) State preemption laws prohibit localities from regulating the ownership , transportation , and possession of firearms . Georgia also has a law preventing localities from enacting ordinances or lawsuits to classify gun ranges as nuisances . This means that local parks , offices , etc. of non-Federal government agencies may not prohibit those with a valid Georgia Weapons License from carrying . Federal regulations continue to prohibit carrying weapons on Corps of Engineers and US Postal Service property . \n",

      "\u001b[1mQuestion 40: when does a tv show go into syndication ?\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Short Answer: \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[1mDocument url: \u001b[0mhttps://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Broadcast_syndication&amp;oldid=837862653\n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1)Broadcast syndication - Wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) First - run syndication in the 1970s also made it possible for some shows that were no longer wanted by television networks to remain on the air . In 1971 , ABC canceled The Lawrence Welk Show , which went on to produce new episodes in syndication for another 11 years , and currently continues to much success in weekend reruns ( with new segments featuring Welk cast members inserted within the episodes ) distributed to PBS stations by the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority . Also in 1971 , CBS dropped Lassie and Hee Haw , the latter show 's run ending as part of the network 's cancellation of all of its rural - oriented shows ( known then as `` rural purge '' , which also resulted in the cancellations of The Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres ) . Lassie entered first - run syndication for two years , while Hee Haw continued to produce new episodes until 1992 . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Throughout the mid-to - late 1980s into the early 1990s , sitcoms continued to enter first - run syndication after being canceled by the networks , the most successful of which were Mama 's Family and Charles In Charge . Other sitcoms during this time to enter first - run syndication after network cancellation included Silver Spoons , Punky Brewster , Webster , It 's a Living , Too Close for Comfort , 9 to 5 , What 's Happening ! ! , and WKRP in Cincinnati . Many of these sitcoms produced new shows in syndication mainly to have enough episodes for a profitable run in reruns . Other sitcoms , such as Small Wonder , Out of This World , The Munsters Today , and Harry and the Hendersons ( as well as more action - adventure oriented series like Superboy and My Secret Identity ) enjoyed success in syndication throughout their entire run . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Syndication of older episodes can also increase exposure for a television show that is still airing first - run network episodes . In the case of the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory , its syndication , particularly on TBS , is one of the reasons attributed for a rise in first - run ratings for its sixth season . The sixth - season episode `` The Bakersfield Expedition '' , for example , was the first episode of that series to attract 20 million viewers . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Off - network syndication can take several forms . The most common form is known as strip syndication or daily syndication , when episodes of a television series are shown daily five times a week in the same time slot . In the 1960s and 1970s , independent stations with no news departments began viewing strip syndication as a necessary means of obtaining effective counterprogramming to the local news programs airing on network affiliates . Typically , this means that enough episodes must exist ( 88 episodes , or four seasons , is the usual minimum , though many syndicators prefer a fully rounded 100 episodes ) to allow for continual strip syndication to take place over the course of several months , without episodes being repeated . However , there are exceptions , such as the 65 - episode block ( common in children 's programming ) , which allows for a 13 - week cycle of daily showings , so there will only be four repeats in a year . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In some cases , more than one episode is shown daily . Half - hour sitcoms are sometimes syndicated in groups of two or four episodes , taking up one or two hours of broadcast time . If a series is not strip syndicated , it may be aired once a week , instead of five times a week . This allows shows with fewer episodes to last long in syndication , but it also may mean viewers will tire of waiting a week for the next episode of a show they have already seen and stop watching . More often , hour - long dramas in their first several runs in syndication are offered weekly ; sitcoms are more likely to get stripped . In recent years , there has been something of a trend toward showing two consecutive episodes of a program on Saturday and Sunday nights after prime time ( generally following the local news ) . This pattern has been particularly prominent for shows which are still in production but have run long enough to have many previous episodes available . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Broadcasting syndication is the license to broadcast television programs and radio programs by multiple television stations and radio stations , without going through a broadcast network . It is common in the United States where broadcast programming is scheduled by television networks with local independent affiliates . Syndication is less of a practice in the rest of the world , as most countries have centralized networks or television stations without local affiliates ; although less common , shows can be syndicated internationally . The three main types of syndication are `` first - run syndication '' , which is programming that is broadcast for the first time as a syndicated show and is made specifically to sell directly into syndication ; `` off - network syndication '' , which is the licensing of a program that was originally run on network TV or , in some cases , first - run syndication ( colloquially called a `` rerun '' ) ; and `` public broadcasting syndication '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) For the 2009 -- 2010 season , the Fox game show Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader ? moved to syndication with a new , less expensive format . Do n't Forget the Lyrics ! followed for the 2010 -- 2011 season . Deal , suffering from falling ratings , was canceled in February 2010 , with the final episodes airing in late May of that same year . 5th Grader and Do n't Forget the Lyrics were canceled the following year for the same reason ( although reruns of 5th Grader remain on cable ) . Reruns of the popular Discovery Channel show Cash Cab began airing in syndication in January 2011 . Reruns of the GSN dating game show Baggage first aired in syndication as a test run in early 2011 on stations owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group , which preceded its full launch into other markets in fall 2012 ; although it was removed from syndication after one season . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Babylon 5 began life in 1993 on the Prime Time Entertainment Network ( PTEN ) , moved into syndicated distribution when its network was displaced by WB / UPN - affiliated stations , and eventually ended its final season on TNT ( 1998 ) . In 1997 Earth : Final Conflict , based on ideas from Gene Roddenberry , premiered in syndication . Three years later , a second Gene Roddenberry series , Andromeda also premiered in syndication . As emerging networks WB and UPN signed contracts with formerly - independent stations , and the syndication market shrunk , Andromeda season 5 moved to the Syfy Channel ( 2004 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Syndication can take the form of either weekly or daily syndication . Game shows , some `` tabloid '' and entertainment news shows , and talk shows are broadcast daily on weekdays , while most other first - run syndicated shows are broadcast on a weekly basis and are usually aired on weekends only . Big discussion occurred in the 1990s and 2000s about whether previously aired episodes of a show could become syndicated while new episodes of it continued to air on its original network . There had been much opposition to this idea and it was generally viewed to lead to the death of the show . However , licensing a program for syndication actually resulted in the increased popularity for shows that remained in production . A prime example is Law & Order . \n",

The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed over $272 million worldwide . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) On April 22 , 2017 , the studio delayed the release date once again , to February 9 , 2018 , in order to allow more time for post-production ; months later , on August 25 , the studio moved the release forward two weeks . The film premiered on January 26 , 2018 in theatres and IMAX . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In the United States and Canada , The Death Cure was released alongside the wide expansion of Hostiles , and was expected to gross around $20 million from 3,786 theaters in its opening weekend . The film made $1.5 million from Thursday night previews , in between the $1.1 million made by the first film and $1.7 million by the second , and $8.4 million on its first day . It ended up opening to $24.2 million , down from the previous film but still finishing atop the box office . In its second weekend the film dropped 58 % to $10.2 million , finishing second behind Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) On March 18 , 2016 , it was reported that actor Dylan O'Brien was injured on set and was hospitalized . James Dashner announced via Twitter that the production was postponed after the accident . It was said that the producers were `` looking to '' resume filming around mid-May . According to the Directors Guild of Canada 's production list , the film was scheduled to resume filming on May 9 , and complete principal photography on July 26 . However , on April 29 , 2016 , production was shut down indefinitely as O'Brien's injuries were more serious than previously thought . \n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Short Answer: \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[1mDocument url: \u001b[0mhttps://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=San_Andreas_Fault&amp;oldid=808545169\n",

      "1)San Andreas fault - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The San Andreas Fault has had some notable earthquakes in historic times : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The southern segment ( also known as the Mojave segment ) begins near Bombay Beach , California . Box Canyon , near the Salton Sea , contains upturned strata associated with that section of the fault . The fault then runs along the southern base of the San Bernardino Mountains , crosses through the Cajon Pass and continues northwest along the northern base of the San Gabriel Mountains . These mountains are a result of movement along the San Andreas Fault and are commonly called the Transverse Range . In Palmdale , a portion of the fault is easily examined at a roadcut for the Antelope Valley Freeway . The fault continues northwest alongside the Elizabeth Lake Road to the town of Elizabeth Lake . As it passes the towns of Gorman , Tejon Pass and Frazier Park , the fault begins to bend northward , forming the `` Big Bend '' . This restraining bend is thought to be where the fault locks up in Southern California , with an earthquake - recurrence interval of roughly 140 -- 160 years . Northwest of Frazier Park , the fault runs through the Carrizo Plain , a long , treeless plain where much of the fault is plainly visible . The Elkhorn Scarp defines the fault trace along much of its length within the plain . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The main southern section of the San Andreas Fault proper has only existed for about 5 million years . The first known incarnation of the southern part of the fault was Clemens Well - Fenner - San Francisquito fault zone around 22 -- 13 Ma . This system added the San Gabriel Fault as a primary focus of movement between 10 -- 5 Ma . Currently , it is believed that the modern San Andreas will eventually transfer its motion toward a fault within the Eastern California Shear Zone . This complicated evolution , especially along the southern segment , is mostly caused by either the `` Big Bend '' and / or a difference in the motion vector between the plates and the trend of the fault and it surrounding branches . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The northern segment of the fault runs from Hollister , through the Santa Cruz Mountains , epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake , then up the San Francisco Peninsula , where it was first identified by Professor Lawson in 1895 , then offshore at Daly City near Mussel Rock . This is the approximate location of the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . The fault returns onshore at Bolinas Lagoon just north of Stinson Beach in Marin County . It returns underwater through the linear trough of Tomales Bay which separates the Point Reyes Peninsula from the mainland , runs just east of the Bodega Heads through Bodega Bay and back underwater , returning onshore at Fort Ross . ( In this region around the San Francisco Bay Area several significant `` sister faults '' run more - or-less parallel , and each of these can create significantly destructive earthquakes . ) From Fort Ross , the northern segment continues overland , forming in part a linear valley through which the Gualala River flows . It goes back offshore at Point Arena . After that , it runs underwater along the coast until it nears Cape Mendocino , where it begins to bend to the west , terminating at the Mendocino Triple Junction . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The central segment of the San Andreas Fault runs in a northwestern direction from Parkfield to Hollister . While the southern section of the fault and the parts through Parkfield experience earthquakes , the rest of the central section of the fault exhibits a phenomenon called aseismic creep , where the fault slips continuously without causing earthquakes . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The fault was first identified in 1895 by Professor Andrew Lawson of UC Berkeley , who discovered the northern zone . It is often described as having been named after San Andreas Lake , a small body of water that was formed in a valley between the two plates . However , according to some of his reports from 1895 and 1908 , Lawson actually named it after the surrounding San Andreas Valley . Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , Lawson concluded that the fault extended all the way into southern California . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) A 2008 paper , studying past earthquakes along the Pacific coastal zone , found a correlation in time between seismic events on the northern San Andreas Fault and the southern part of the Cascadia subduction zone ( which stretches from Vancouver Island to northern California ) . Scientists believe quakes on the Cascadia subduction zone may have triggered most of the major quakes on the northern San Andreas within the past 3,000 years . The evidence also shows the rupture direction going from north to south in each of these time - correlated events . However the 1906 San Francisco earthquake seems to have been the exception to this correlation because the plate movement was moved mostly from south to north and it was not preceded by a major quake in the Cascadia zone . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In 2004 , work began just north of Parkfield on the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth ( SAFOD ) . The goal of SAFOD is to drill a hole nearly 3 kilometres ( 1.9 mi ) into the Earth 's crust and into the San Andreas Fault . An array of sensors will be installed to record earthquakes that happen near this area . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) In 1953 , geologist Thomas Dibblee astounded the scientific establishment with his conclusion that hundreds of miles of lateral movement could occur along the fault . A project called the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth ( SAFOD ) near Parkfield , Monterey County , is drilling into the fault to improve prediction and recording of future earthquakes . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> During play , a team consists of six players : a goaltender and five `` runners '' . A runner is any non-goalkeeper position player , including forwards , transition players , and defenders . Runners usually specialize in one of these roles and substitute off the field when the ball moves from one end to the other . When the sport originated teams played with six runners . However , in 1953 the sixth runner , a position called rover , was eliminated . The goalkeeper can be replaced by another runner , often when a delayed penalty has been called on the other team or at the end of games by teams that are behind to help score goals . </P>\n",

      "1)Box lacrosse - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Box lacrosse is the most popular version of the sport in the Czech Republic . It is also played to a marginal degree in Australia , primarily by players who have played field lacrosse . Club level box lacrosse leagues in the United States have increased the number of players exposed to the sport , including the : Baltimore Indoor Lacrosse League , the Philadelphia Box Lacrosse Association , and the Metro Area Box Lacrosse League . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Box lacrosse , also known as boxla , box , or indoor lacrosse , is an indoor version of lacrosse played mostly in North America . The game originated in Canada in the 1930s , where it is more popular than field lacrosse and is the national summer sport . Box lacrosse is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each , and is traditionally played on an ice hockey rink once the ice has been removed or covered . The playing area is called a box , in contrast to the open playing field of field lacrosse . The object of the game is to use a lacrosse stick to catch , carry , and pass the ball in an effort to score by shooting a solid rubber lacrosse ball into the opponent 's goal . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Canadian Lacrosse Association began sponsoring box lacrosse . In 1932 , the Mann Cup , the most prestigious lacrosse trophy in Canada , was contended for under box lacrosse rules for the first time . Previously , the national senior men 's lacrosse championship , awarded since 1901 , was competed for under field lacrosse rules . The Mann Cup is an annual tournament that presents the champion of the Western Lacrosse Association and Major Series Lacrosse in a best of seven national championship . A few years later , in 1937 , the Minto Cup , began being awarded under box lacrosse rules to the junior men 's champions . Currently the Canadian Lacrosse Association oversees the Mann Cup , the Minto Cup , the Presidents Cup ( Senior B national championship ) the Founders Cup ( Junior B national championship ) all under box lacrosse rules . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Historically , box lacrosse has been exclusively a men 's sport . Women who played the sport of lacrosse typically played the women 's field lacrosse version . Recently , Ontario , Alberta , Nova Scotia and British Columbia have established girls ' and women 's box lacrosse leagues . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Even as box lacrosse grows in the United States , the American goalkeeper is a rarity . The skills required to be a successful field lacrosse goaltender and a successful box lacrosse goaltender are very different and do not lend well to one another . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Similar to fighting in ice hockey , fighting is tolerated in professional box lacrosse . Professional players are not automatically subject to ejection , but incur a five - minute major penalty . In Canadian Lacrosse Association play , players are assessed a five - minute major penalty plus a game misconduct . Fighting in youth or club level box lacrosse is typically penalized with expulsion and suspensions . In 1990 , when the Six Nations created the new Mohawk lacrosse league , fighting was specifically targeted as unacceptable . Violators were ejected from the game in which the altercation occurred and given a minimum three game suspension . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The first professional box lacrosse games were held in 1931 . That summer , the arena owners formed the International Lacrosse League , featuring four teams : the Montreal Canadiens , Montreal Maroons , Toronto Maple Leafs , and Cornwall Colts . The league lasted only two seasons . In the wake of the original International Lacrosse League opened the American Box Lacrosse League featuring six teams : two in New York City , and one each in Brooklyn , Toronto , Boston , and Baltimore . The league played to small crowds on outdoor fields such as Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park , before closing midway through its inaugural season . Lacrosse was officially declared Canada 's National Summer Sport with the passage of the National Sports Act ( Bill C - 212 ) on May 12 , 1994 . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) A player 's lacrosse stick must be between 40 inches ( 1.0 m ) and 46 inches ( 1.2 m ) in length ( youth levels may use shorter sticks ) . In most box lacrosse leagues , the use of a traditional wooden stick is allowed . However , almost no lacrosse players use wooden sticks anymore , preferring aluminum or another metal , and a plastic head . In the NLL , wooden lacrosse sticks are not allowed . Besides a lacrosse stick , each player must also wear a certain amount of protective equipment , including a lacrosse helmet with facemask , lacrosse gloves , arm and shoulder pads , and back / kidney pads . Rib pads are optional in some leagues . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) In some box leagues , especially the NLL , the five `` runners '' wear helmets specifically designed for box lacrosse . These helmets consist of a hockey helmet with a box lacrosse face mask attached instead of a hockey cage . \n",

Nine cities will have hosted the Olympic Games more than once : Athens ( 1896 and 2004 Summer Olympics ) , Paris ( 1900 , 1924 and 2024 Summer Olympics ) , London ( 1908 , 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics ) , St. Moritz ( 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics ) , Lake Placid ( 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics ) , Los Angeles ( 1932 , 1984 and 2028 Summer Olympics ) , Innsbruck ( 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics ) , Tokyo ( 1964 and 2020 Summer Olympics ) and Beijing ( 2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics ) . In addition , Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics . London became the first city to have hosted three Games with the 2012 Summer Olympics . Paris will become the second city to do this with the 2024 Summer Olympics , followed by Los Angeles as the third in 2028 . The United States has hosted a total of eight Olympic Games , more than any other country , followed by France with five editions . Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , and the United Kingdom have each hosted three Games . \n",

      "\n",
      "4) The Games have primarily been hosted in the continents of Europe ( 36 editions ) and North America ( 12 editions ) ; eight Games have been hosted in Asia and two have been hosted in Oceania . In 2016 , Rio de Janeiro became South America 's first Olympic host city , while the African continent has yet to hold the Games . Other major geographic regions which have never hosted the Olympics include the Middle East , the Indian subcontinent , the Caribbean , and Southeast Asia . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Host cities are selected by the IOC membership , usually seven years in advance . The selection process lasts approximately two years . In the first stage , any city in the world may submit an application to become a host city . After 10 months , the Executive Board of the IOC decides which applicant city will become official candidates as based on the recommendation of a working group that reviews the applications . In a second stage , the candidate cities are investigated thoroughly by an Evaluation Commission , which then submits a final short list of cities to be considered for selection . The host city is then chosen by vote of the IOC session , a general meeting of IOC members . \n",

      "\n",
      "2) The three seconds rule ( also referred to as the three - second rule or three in the key , with often termed a lane violation ) requires that in basketball , a player shall not remain in the opponents ' restricted area for more than three consecutive seconds while their team is in control of a live ball in the frontcourt and the game clock is running . \n",

      "\n",
      "4) The three - second rule came about in part following a game at Madison Square Garden between the University of Kentucky ( UK ) and New York University ( NYU ) in 1935 , won by NYU 23 - 22 . The university of Kentucky team did not take their own referee , a common practice at the time , despite advice to the UK coach Adolph Rupp from Notre Dame coach George Keogan , who had lost to NYU the week prior and who warned Rupp of the discrepancies in officiating between the Midwest and the East . The game was rough . UK was unable to run its normal offense ( which consisted of using screens ) without being called for a foul . New York University 's Irving Terjesen and Irwin Klein combined to guard one of UK 's major players , Leroy Edwards , allowing him to score a mere 6 points ( the lowest output of his career ) . The New York Post reacted with alarm : `` The score says that NYU is the best college basketball team in the country and that the East still is supreme . But if Frank Lane , the referee from the Midwest , had worked the game , it 's safe to assume big Leroy Edwards would have been given a fantastic number of foul shots . Minor mayhem was committed on the person of Edwards by Terjesen and Klein . Something will have to be done or the game will become entirely too rough . '' \n",

      "\u001b[1mQuestion 48: when were the plus and minus signs first recorded ?\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> In Europe in the early 15th century the letters `` P '' and `` M '' were generally used . The symbols ( P with line p̄ for più , i.e. , plus , and M with line m̄ for meno , i.e. , minus ) appeared for the first time in Luca Pacioli 's mathematics compendium , Summa de arithmetica , geometria , proportioni et proportionalità , first printed and published in Venice in 1494 . The + is a simplification of the Latin `` et '' ( comparable to the ampersand & ) . The − may be derived from a tilde written over m when used to indicate subtraction ; or it may come from a shorthand version of the letter m itself . In his 1489 treatise Johannes Widmann referred to the symbols − and + as minus and mer ( Modern German mehr ; `` more '' ) : `` was − ist , das ist minus , und das + ist das mer '' . They were n't used for addition and subtraction here , but to indicate surplus and deficit ; their first use in their modern sense appears in a book by Henricus Grammateus in 1518 . </P>\n",

      "1)Plus and minus signs - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Some elementary teachers use raised plus and minus signs before numbers to show they are positive or negative numbers . For example , subtracting − 5 from 3 might be read as `` positive three take away negative 5 '' and be shown as \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Though the signs now seem as familiar as the alphabet or the Hindu - Arabic numerals , they are not of great antiquity . The Egyptian hieroglyphic sign for addition , for example , resembled a pair of legs walking in the direction in which the text was written ( Egyptian could be written either from right to left or left to right ) , with the reverse sign indicating subtraction : \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The minus sign ( − ) has three main uses in mathematics : \n",
      "\n",
      "5) In the algebraic notation used to record games of chess , the plus sign ( + ) is used to denote a move that puts the opponent into check . A double plus ( + + ) is sometimes used to denote double check . Combinations of the plus and minus signs are used to evaluate a move ( + / − , + / = , = / + , − / + ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In most programming languages , subtraction and negation are indicated with the ASCII hyphen - minus character , - . In APL a raised minus sign ( Unicode U + 00AF ) is used to denote a negative number , as in _̄ 3 . While in J a negative number is denoted by an underscore , as in _5 . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In grading systems ( such as examination marks ) , the plus sign indicates a grade one level higher and the minus sign a grade lower . For example , B − ( `` B minus '' ) is one grade lower than B. Sometimes this is extended to two plus or minus signs ; for example A++ is two grades higher than A . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Plus and minus signs are often used in tree view on a computer screen to show if a folder is collapsed or not . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The hyphen - minus sign ( - ) is the ASCII alternative / version of the minus sign , and doubles as a hyphen . It is usually shorter in length than the plus sign and sometimes at a different height . It can be used as a substitute for the true minus sign when the character set is limited to ASCII . Most programming languages and other computer readable languages do this , since ASCII is generally available as a subset of most character encodings , while U + 2212 is a Unicode feature only . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) In C and some other computer programming languages , two plus signs indicate the increment operator and two minus signs a decrement . For example , x++ means `` increment the value of x by one '' and x -- means `` decrement the value of x by one '' . By extension , `` + + '' is sometimes used in computing terminology to signify an improvement , as in the name of the language C++ . \n",

      "1) The episode began with Richard telling Monica that he 's never gotten over her and that he wants to marry and have children with her . Monica is left confused and when Chandler talks about how he hates marriage and ca n't see why anyone should get married she starts to feel unsure about their whole relationship . After Joey confirms to Monica that Chandler seemingly has no interest in getting married , Monica decides enough is enough and goes to meet Richard - she describes his apartment as `` a grown - up 's apartment '' and talks to him about the unfairness of the situation . Joey meanwhile tells Chandler how his plan has backfired on him and he is now in serious danger of losing Monica for good , and he leaves on a frantic search intending to propose when he finds her . After Monica leaves Richard 's apartment , Chandler comes and asks for Monica - he starts off by saying that Richard is a very bad man and he had his chances but he blew them . He also says that he and Monica are meant to be together and now Richard has blown Chandler 's chances , revealing he 'd intended to propose . Richard advises Chandler to go to Monica , warning that if he succeeds in winning her back , he must never let her go . \n",

      "3) After weeks of preparation , Chandler is ready to propose to Monica . While at a restaurant , Chandler begins his proposal however before he can ask the question Monica 's ex-boyfriend Richard ( Tom Selleck ) walks in and the moment is lost . When the others come home from the charity event , they constantly ask to see Monica 's hand , thinking Chandler proposed already . Feeling that Monica will figure out that Chandler plans to propose ( Chandler : `` Who walks into a room and asks to see a person 's hands ? ! '' ) , Joey suggests that Chandler pretend he does n't care about marriage and never wants to get married . Meanwhile , Richard approaches Monica at work and declares his love for her . \n",

      "5) Entertainment Weekly listed Chandler and Monica 's proposal scene in their `` 26 Great ' I Love You 's '' . \n",

      "6) Sources suggest that David Schwimmer was actually out of the country filming Band of Brothers when the final scenes of the episode were filmed , hence why Ross is not there when the friends hug Monica and Chandler on hearing their announcement . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) `` The One with the Proposal '' is a double length episode of the television situation comedy Friends . It first aired on May 18 , 2000 , as the finale to the sixth season . It is normally transmitted as a whole episode in a one - hour slot , but when it is split for a half - hour slot the episodes are differentiated by having the title suffixed with Part One and Part Two .

      "9) Rachel takes Phoebe and Joey to a charity event helping children , including a silent auction . While Phoebe is obviously over-drinking ( Phoebe : `` The more I drink , the less there is for the kids to drink ! '' ) , Joey has bigger problems ; misunderstanding the silent auction process , Joey thought that bidders guessed an item 's worth , with the prize going to the person with the closest guess . ( Rachel : Why would a charity give away a free boat ? Joey : I do n't know ... charity ? ) Joey `` guesses '' $20,000 and `` wins '' a yacht . Rachel and Joey try to convince the next highest bidder to buy the boat , but in the process of persuading the man of the boat 's virtues , Joey changes his mind and wants it for himself , although he can barely afford it . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The episode very nearly served as the series finale , given that NBC and Warner Bros. were in negotiations over the show 's future up until four days before the episode aired . The series ' stars demanded $750,000 salary for each actor per episode and agreed to a contract for two additional seasons , an agreement that later stretched into a further two seasons at $1 million salary for each of the stars . \n",

      "2) Dance Academy week was split among two episodes . The June 20 episode covered the first day of the Academy . The first task for the 10 all - stars was to watch solo dances by each of the competitors who were sent through from the auditions . From these , each all - star selected five dancers ( at least three from their own dance style ) , from the large number of auditioners , to join their `` team '' . If a dancer was selected by more than one all - star , he or she could choose which all - star 's team to join . Choreographer Warren Carlyle and the all - stars then taught the 50 remaining competitors a Broadway couples dance routine in 90 minutes , and dancers from each team were paired with dancers from another team . After all of the couples danced , each all - star was required to cut one dancer from his or her team , leaving a total of 40 contestants .

      "4) The June 27 episode covered days two and three of Academy week . On day two , the all - stars each narrowed down their teams to three and then two dancers , based first on a hip - hop routine for pairs choreographed by Tabitha and Napoleon D'umo , and then on a contemporary routine , created by Travis Wall , danced simultaneously by the remaining three members of each team . On the last day , the last two dancers from each team danced a solo just for their own all - star .

      "3) Tulsidas began writing the Ramcharitmanas in Ayodhya in Vikram Samvat 1631 ( 1574 CE ) . The exact date is stated within the poem as being the ninth day of the month of Chaitra , which is the birthday of Rama , Rama Navami . Ramcharitmanas was composed at Ayodhya , Varanasi & Chitrakoot . India was under the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar ( 1556 - 1605 CE ) during this period .

Shiva ends his narration of the Rama Katha to Parvati as does Kakbhushundi to Garuda . It is not mentioned whether Yajnavalkya finishes his recitation to Bharadwaj .

      "9) Tulsidas begins the story with an invocation to various deities , his guru , and saints who have preceded him and those who will succeed him in the future . Homage is paid to Valmiki for bringing the Ramayana to the devotees of Rama . Next are introduced and praised the various characters of the epic beginning with the birthplace of Rama , the holy city of Ayodhya . Praises are bestowed on Dasharatha , the king of Ayodhya and Rama 's father , and his queens Kausalya , Kaikeyi and Sumitra . Tulsidas then praises King Janaka , the father - in - law of Rama ) , and his family . He goes on to praise the brothers of Rama - Bharata , Lakshman & Shatrughna and sings the glories of Hanuman , the constant companion to Rama , Sugriva , the monkey king and Jambavan , the leader of bears . Next , the characters of Sita and Rama are introduced . \n",

      "10) The residents of Ayodhya ca n't spare the thought of being away from Rama and decide to join him in the forest . Rama , Sita , Lakshman and Sumantra go incognito and in the dead of the night leave the city and move into the forest . They leave for a place called Sringaverapur after which they meet Guha , the Nishad king . They arrive at Prayag , the holy city where the Rivers Ganges , Yamuna and Saraswati meet . Rama meets with the Sage Bharadwaj at his ashram . Rama is overwhelmed with the reception and love shown by the people inhabiting the banks of the Yamuna . Rama then meets Sage Valmiki , the author of the Ramayan at Chitrakoot dham . Valmiki recognises the true opulence of Rama and sings His praises . At this point Tulsidas takes great care to describe the beauty of the land of Chitrakoot with some inspiring poetry . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> In the late 1700s , traffic in the United States was RHT based on teamsters ' use of large freight wagons pulled by several pairs of horses . The wagons had no driver 's seat , so the ( typically right - handed ) postilion held his whip in his right hand and thus sat on the left rear horse . Seated on the left , the driver preferred that other wagons pass him on the left so that he could be sure to keep clear of the wheels of oncoming wagons . </P>\n",

      "4)Left - and right - hand traffic - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Historically there was less consistency in the relationship of the position of the driver to the handedness of traffic . Most American cars produced before 1910 were RHD . In 1908 Henry Ford standardised the Model T as LHD in RHT America , arguing that with RHD and RHT , the passenger was obliged to `` get out on the street side and walk around the car '' and that with steering from the left , the driver `` is able to see even the wheels of the other car and easily avoids danger . '' By 1915 other manufacturers followed Ford 's lead , due to the popularity of the Model T . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In RHT jurisdictions , vehicles are configured with LHD , with the driver sitting on the left side . In LHT jurisdictions , the reverse is true . The driver 's side , the side closest to the centre of the road , is sometimes called the offside , while the passenger side , the side closest to the side of the road , is sometimes called the nearside . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Sweden was LHT from about 1734 to 1967 , despite having land borders with RHT countries , and approximately 90 percent of cars being left - hand drive ( LHD ) vehicles . A referendum was held in 1955 , with an overwhelming majority voting against a change to RHT . Nevertheless , some years later the government ordered a conversion , which took place at 5 am on Sunday , 3 September 1967 . The accident rate dropped sharply after the change , but soon rose back to near its original level . The day was known as Dagen H ( `` H - Day '' ) , the ' H ' being for Högertrafik ( `` right traffic '' ) . When Iceland switched the following year , it was known as H - dagurinn , again meaning `` H - Day '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Many of the countries with LHT are former British colonies in the Caribbean , Southern Africa , Southeast Asia , South Asia , Australia , and New Zealand . Japan , Thailand , Nepal , Bhutan , Mozambique , Suriname , East Timor , and Indonesia are among those LHT countries outside the former British Empire . In Europe , only four countries still drive on the left : the United Kingdom , Ireland , Malta , and Cyprus , all of which are on islands that have no direct road connections with countries driving on the right . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Within the European Union , vehicles must be equipped with one or two rear - facing red rear fog lamps . A single rear fog lamp must be located between the vehicle 's longitudinal centreline and the outer extent of the driver 's side of the vehicle . When importing a vehicle to a country which drives on the opposite side of the road , this sometimes requires the purchase and installation of local - market lighting components . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The first keep - right law for driving in the United States was passed in 1792 and applied to the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike . New York formalized RHT in 1804 , New Jersey in 1813 and Massachusetts in 1821 . \n",

      "2) Into the Badlands is an American television series that premiered on AMC November 15 , 2015 . Based on the 16th - century novel by Chinese author Wu Cheng ' En , Journey to the West , the series features a story about a warrior and a young boy who journey through a dangerous feudal land together seeking enlightenment . AMC renewed the show for a 10 - episode second season , which premiered on March 19 , 2017 .

'' Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote , `` The action scenes scattered throughout Into the Badlands are not just stirringly presented , they represent a test passed with flying , and bloody , colors . This efficient AMC series is an homage to classic Samurai films and kinetic action fare churned out by Hong Kong maestros of furious fists , and if the TV drama had failed to meet the standards set by the sturdiest examples of those genres , it would have seemed superfluous at best . Fortunately , star Daniel Wu is more than up to the task of occupying the center of this streamlined story of vengeance , tyranny and roundhouse kicks . '' \n",

      "2) Slartibartfast is a character in The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , a comedy / science fiction series created by Douglas Adams . The character appears in the first and third novels , the first and third radio series ( and the LP adaptation of the first radio series ) , the 1981 television series and the 2005 feature film . The character was modelled after actor John Le Mesurier . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Douglas Adams writes in the notes accompanying the published volume of original radio scripts that he wanted Slartibartfast 's name to sound very rude , but still actually be broadcastable . He therefore started with the name `` Phartiphukborlz '' , and changed bits of it until it would be acceptable to the BBC . He came closer to achieving this goal in the following episode , with the double - act Lunkwill and Fook . He adds to this statement in Do n't Panic : The Official Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy Companion , an analysis by Neil Gaiman : \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Slartibartfast is a Magrathean , and a designer of planets . His favourite part of the job is creating coastlines , the most notable of which are the fjords found on the coast of Norway on planet Earth , for which he won an award . While trapped on prehistoric Earth , Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect see Slartibartfast 's signature deep inside a glacier in ancient Norway . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) In Life , the Universe and Everything Slartibartfast has joined the Campaign for Real Time ( or `` CamTim '' as the volunteers casually refer to it , a reference to CAMRA ) which tries to preserve events as they happened before time travelling was invented . He picks up Arthur and Ford from Lord 's Cricket Ground with his Starship Bistromath , after which they head out to stop the robots of Krikkit from bringing together the pieces of the Wikkit Gate . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Slartibartfast was first portrayed in the 1978 radio serial , in which he was voiced by Richard Vernon , who also portrayed him in the 1981 live - action miniseries . Richard Griffiths voiced him in the 2004 radio series . He was portrayed by Bill Nighy in the 2005 film adaptation of the first novel . \n",

      "7) In any event , the new Earth is not required and , much to Slartibartfast 's disgust , its owners suggested that he take a quick skiing holiday on his glaciers before dismantling them . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) When Earth Mk. II is being made , Slartibartfast is assigned to the continent of Africa . He is unhappy about this because he has begun `` doing it with fjords again '' ( arguing that they give a continent a lovely baroque feel ) , but has been told by his superiors that they are `` not equatorial enough '' . \n",

      "9) ... One thing I do n't think I explained in the script book was that I was also teasing the typist , Geoffrey ( Perkins ) 's secretary , because ... she 'd be typing out this long and extraordinary name which would be quite an effort to type and right at the beginning he says ' My name is not important , and I 'm not going to tell you what it is ' .

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> The central nervous system ( CNS ) is the part of the nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord . The central nervous system is so named because it integrates information it receives from , and coordinates and influences the activity of , all parts of the bodies of bilaterally symmetric animals -- that is , all multicellular animals except sponges and radially symmetric animals such as jellyfish -- and it contains the majority of the nervous system .

The brain makes up the largest portion of the central nervous system , and is often the main structure referred to when speaking of the nervous system . The brain is the major functional unit of the central nervous system . While the spinal cord has certain processing ability such as that of spinal locomotion and can process reflexes , the brain is the major processing unit of the nervous system . \n",

      "4) Planarians , members of the phylum Platyhelminthes ( flatworms ) , have the simplest , clearly defined delineation of a nervous system into a central nervous system ( CNS ) and a peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . Their primitive brains , consisting of two fused anterior ganglia , and longitudinal nerve cords form the CNS ; the laterally projecting nerves form the PNS . A molecular study found that more than 95 % of the 116 genes involved in the nervous system of planarians , which includes genes related to the CNS , also exist in humans . Like planarians , vertebrates have a distinct CNS and PNS , though more complex than those of planarians . \n",

      "7) The cerebrum of cerebral hemispheres make up the largest visual portion of the human brain . Various structures combine to form the cerebral hemispheres , among others : the cortex , basal ganglia , amygdala and hippocampus . The hemispheres together control a large portion of the functions of the human brain such as emotion , memory , perception and motor functions . Apart from this the cerebral hemispheres stand for the cognitive capabilities of the brain . \n",

      "9) Microscopically , there are differences between the neurons and tissue of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system . The central nervous system is divided in white and gray matter . This can also be seen macroscopically on brain tissue . The white matter consists of axons and oligodendrocytes , while the gray matter consists of neurons and unmyelinated fibers . Both tissues include a number of glial cells ( although the white matter contains more ) , which are often referred to as supporting cells of the central nervous system . Different forms of glial cells have different functions , some acting almost as scaffolding for neuroblasts to climb during neurogenesis such as bergmann glia , while others such as microglia are a specialized form of macrophage , involved in the immune system of the brain as well as the clearance of various metabolites from the brain tissue . Astrocytes may be involved with both clearance of metabolites as well as transport of fuel and various beneficial substances to neurons from the capillaries of the brain . Upon CNS injury astrocytes will proliferate , causing gliosis , a form of neuronal scar tissue , lacking in functional neurons . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) From and to the spinal cord are projections of the peripheral nervous system in the form of spinal nerves ( sometimes segmental nerves ) . The nerves connect the spinal cord to skin , joints , muscles etc. and allow for the transmission of efferent motor as well as afferent sensory signals and stimuli . This allows for voluntary and involuntary motions of muscles , as well as the perception of senses . All in all 31 spinal nerves project from the brain stem , some forming plexa as they branch out , such as the brachial plexa , sacral plexa etc . Each spinal nerve will carry both sensory and motor signals , but the nerves synapse at different regions of the spinal cord , either from the periphery to sensory relay neurons that relay the information to the CNS or from the CNS to motor neurons , which relay the information out . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> The game show production team of Mark Goodson and Bill Todman was responsible for producing the original as well as the revival versions of the game show . Goodson - Todman staffer Bob Stewart is credited with creating the original version of The Price Is Right . Roger Dobkowitz was the producer from 1984 to 2008 , having worked with the program as a production staffer since the show 's debut after graduating from San Francisco State University . Occasionally , Dobkowitz appeared on - camera when answering a question posed by the host , usually relating to the show 's history or records . When he left the show at the end of season 36 , Variety reported that it was unclear whether he was retiring or was fired , although Carey indicated in a later interview with Esquire that Dobkowitz was fired . As of 2011 , the show uses multiple producers , all long - time staffers . Adam Sandler ( not to be confused with the actor ) is the producer of the show . Stan Blits , who joined the show in 1980 and Sue MacIntyre are the co-producers . Kathy Greco joined the show in 1975 and became producer in 2008 ; she announced her retirement October 8 , 2010 on the show 's website , effective at the end of the December 2010 tapings . Her last episode as producer , which aired January 27 , 2011 , featured a theme in tribute to her . The show 's official website featured a series of videos including an interview with Greco as a tribute to her 35 years in the days leading up to her final episode . Frank Wayne , a Goodson - Todman staffer since the 1950s , was the original executive producer of the CBS version of the show . Barker assumed that role after Wayne 's death in March 1988 , as previously stated . Previous producers have included Jay Wolpert , Barbara Hunter and Phil Wayne Rossi ( Wayne 's son ) . Michael Dimich assumed the director 's chair in June 2011 . Marc Breslow , Paul Alter , Bart Eskander and Rich DiPirro each served long stints previously as director . Former associate directors Andrew Felsher and Fred Witten , as well as technical director Glenn Koch , have directed episodes strictly on a fill - in basis . Sandler began directing episodes in 2012 , and became the official director in 2013 . Aside from Barker , the show 's production staff remained intact after Carey became host . FremantleMedia executive Syd Vinnedge was named the program 's new executive producer , with Richards becoming co-executive producer after Dobkowitz 's departure . Richards was a candidate to replace Barker as host in 2007 , before Carey was ultimately chosen . Richards succeeded Vinnedge as executive producer when the 2009 -- 10 season started , with Tracy Verna Soiseth joining Richards as co-executive producer in 2010 . Vinnedge remains credited as an executive consultant to the show . </P>\n",

      "2) The Price Is Right is an American television game show created by Bob Stewart , Mark Goodson and Bill Todman . The show revolves around contestants competing to identify accurate pricing of merchandise to win cash and prizes . Contestants are selected from the studio audience when the announcer proclaims the show 's famous catchphrase , `` Come on down ! '' \n",

      "3) At the beginning of the show , four contestants are called from the audience by the announcer to take a spot on the front row behind bidding podiums , which are embedded into the front edge of the stage . This area is known as `` Contestants ' Row '' . The announcer shouts `` Come on down ! '' after calling each selected contestant 's name , a phrase which has become a trademark of the show . The four contestants in Contestants ' Row compete in a bidding round to determine which contestant will play the next pricing game ( the round is known as `` One Bid , '' which gets its name and format from one of two types of bidding rounds that existed on the 1950s version of the show ) . A prize is shown and each contestant gives a single bid for the item . In the first One - Bid game of each episode , bidding begins with the contestant on the viewer 's left - to - right . In subsequent One - Bid rounds , the order of bidding still moves from the viewer 's left - to - right , but it begins with the contestant most recently called down . Contestants are instructed to bid in whole dollars since the retail price of the item is rounded to the nearest dollar and another contestant 's bid can not be duplicated . If a contestant thinks the others have overbid , he or she bids $1 on the item . The contestant whose bid is closest to the actual retail price of the prize without going over wins that prize and gets to play the subsequent pricing game . If all four contestants overbid , short buzzer tones sound , the lowest bid is announced and the bids are erased . The host then instructs the contestants to re-bid below the lowest previous bid . If a contestant bids the actual retail price , a bell rings and the contestant wins a cash bonus in addition to the prize . From the introduction of the bonus in 1977 until 1998 , the `` perfect bid '' bonus was $100 ; it was permanently increased to the current $500 in 1998 . On The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular , the bonus was $1,000 . After each pricing game , another contestant is called to `` come on down '' to fill the spot of the contestant that won the previous round . The newest contestant bids first in each One Bid round . Contestants who fail to win a One Bid round -- thus never making it onstage to play a pricing game -- receive consolation prizes , currently $300 , often sponsored by companies revealed by the announcer near the end of the show , before the Showcase . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) On May 31 , 2006 , The Price Is Right was featured on the series Gameshow Marathon , one of seven classic game shows hosted by talk show host and actress Ricki Lake . This version combined aspects of the Barker and Davidson versions with the celebrity contestants playing three pricing games , followed by a Showcase Showdown where the two contestants with the highest scores moved on to the Showcase . The winner of the Showcase also earned a spot in Finalists ' Row . This version was announced by Fields and taped in Studio 46 . It also marked the first Price Is Right episode directed by DiPirro , who replaced Eskander as the director on the daytime show in January 2009 . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Three syndicated versions of The Price Is Right have aired . The first two followed the same format as the half - hour daytime version but were intended to air on most stations in the early evening in the pre-prime time slot , and as such they were referred by the announcer as `` the nighttime Price Is Right . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "6) At the end of the episode , the two contestants with the highest winnings , or since 1975 on hour - long episodes , the two Showcase Showdown winners , advance to the Showcase . A `` showcase '' of prizes ( currently two or three prizes ) is presented and the top winner has the option of placing a bid on the total value of the showcase or passing the showcase to the runner - up , who is then required to bid . A second showcase is then presented and the contestant who had not bid on the first showcase makes his or her bid . Unlike the One Bid , the contestant bidding on the second showcase may bid the same amount as their opponent on the first showcase , since the two contestants are bidding on different prize packages . The contestant who has bid nearer to the price of their own showcase without going over wins the prizes in his or her showcase . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The Price Is Right has aired over 8,000 episodes since its debut and is one of the longest - running network series in United States television history . In a 2007 article , TV Guide named The Price Is Right the `` greatest game show of all time . '' The show 's 46th season premiered on September 18 , 2017 . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Bob Barker began hosting The Price Is Right on September 4 , 1972 and completed a 35 - year tenure on June 15 , 2007 . Barker was hired as host while still hosting the stunt comedy show Truth or Consequences . His retirement coincided with his 50th year as a television host . His final show aired on June 15 , 2007 and was repeated in primetime , leading into the network 's coverage of the 34th Daytime Emmy Awards . In addition to hosting , Barker became Executive Producer of the show in March 1988 when Frank Wayne died and continued as such until his retirement , gaining significant creative control over the series between 2000 and his 2007 retirement . He also was responsible for creating several of the show 's pricing games , as well as launching The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular primetime spin - off . Reruns of Barker 's final season were aired throughout the summer from the Monday after his final show ( June 18 , 2007 ) until the Friday before Drew Carey 's debut as host ( October 12 , 2007 ) , when the season 35 finale was re-aired . During his time as host , Barker missed only one taping of four episodes ; Dennis James , then hosting the syndicated nighttime version of the show , filled in for him on these shows in December 1974 . After he became a noted animal rights advocate in 1981 shortly after the death of his wife Dorothy Jo , Barker signed off each broadcast , informing viewers with the public service message , `` Help control the pet population : have your pets spayed or neutered . '' Carey continued the tradition upon becoming the new host . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Road to Price is a six episode reality documentary show aired on the now - defunct CBS Innertube from September 20 to 27 in 2006 . The program featured nine teenage boys driving to Los Angeles in a refurbished mini-school bus as they leave their hometown of Merrimack , New Hampshire in order to be on The Price is Right . The episode of The Price is Right featuring the cast aired September 27 , 2006 . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The game show production team of Mark Goodson and Bill Todman was responsible for producing the original as well as the revival versions of the game show . Goodson - Todman staffer Bob Stewart is credited with creating the original version of The Price Is Right . Roger Dobkowitz was the producer from 1984 to 2008 , having worked with the program as a production staffer since the show 's debut after graduating from San Francisco State University . Occasionally , Dobkowitz appeared on - camera when answering a question posed by the host , usually relating to the show 's history or records . When he left the show at the end of season 36 , Variety reported that it was unclear whether he was retiring or was fired , although Carey indicated in a later interview with Esquire that Dobkowitz was fired . As of 2011 , the show uses multiple producers , all long - time staffers . Adam Sandler ( not to be confused with the actor ) is the producer of the show . Stan Blits , who joined the show in 1980 and Sue MacIntyre are the co-producers . Kathy Greco joined the show in 1975 and became producer in 2008 ; she announced her retirement October 8 , 2010 on the show 's website , effective at the end of the December 2010 tapings . Her last episode as producer , which aired January 27 , 2011 , featured a theme in tribute to her . The show 's official website featured a series of videos including an interview with Greco as a tribute to her 35 years in the days leading up to her final episode . Frank Wayne , a Goodson - Todman staffer since the 1950s , was the original executive producer of the CBS version of the show . Barker assumed that role after Wayne 's death in March 1988 , as previously stated . Previous producers have included Jay Wolpert , Barbara Hunter and Phil Wayne Rossi ( Wayne 's son ) . Michael Dimich assumed the director 's chair in June 2011 . Marc Breslow , Paul Alter , Bart Eskander and Rich DiPirro each served long stints previously as director . Former associate directors Andrew Felsher and Fred Witten , as well as technical director Glenn Koch , have directed episodes strictly on a fill - in basis . Sandler began directing episodes in 2012 , and became the official director in 2013 . Aside from Barker , the show 's production staff remained intact after Carey became host . FremantleMedia executive Syd Vinnedge was named the program 's new executive producer , with Richards becoming co-executive producer after Dobkowitz 's departure . Richards was a candidate to replace Barker as host in 2007 , before Carey was ultimately chosen . Richards succeeded Vinnedge as executive producer when the 2009 -- 10 season started , with Tracy Verna Soiseth joining Richards as co-executive producer in 2010 . Vinnedge remains credited as an executive consultant to the show . \n",

      "1)The bridge on the River Kwai - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The Bridge on the River Kwai is a 1957 British - American epic war film directed by David Lean and starring William Holden , Jack Hawkins , and Alec Guinness , and featuring Sessue Hayakawa . Based on the novel Le Pont de la Rivière Kwai ( 1952 ) by Pierre Boulle , the film is a work of fiction , but borrows the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942 -- 1943 for its historical setting . The movie was filmed in Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) . The bridge in the film was near Kitulgala . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The bridge described in the book did n't actually cross the River Kwai . Pierre Boulle had never been to the bridge . He knew that the ' death railway ' ran parallel to the River Kwae for many miles , and he therefore assumed that it was the Kwae which it crossed just north of Kanchanaburi . This was an incorrect assumption ; the bridge actually crossed the Mae Klong river . The destruction of the bridge as depicted in the film is also entirely fictional . In fact , two bridges were built : a temporary wooden bridge and a permanent steel / concrete bridge a few months later . Both bridges were used for two years , until they were destroyed by Allied bombing . The steel bridge was repaired and is still in use today . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Channel 4 held a poll in 2005 to find the 100 Greatest War Movies : The Bridge on the River Kwai came in at # 10 , behind Black Hawk Down and in front of The Dam Busters . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The British Film Institute placed The Bridge on the River Kwai as the eleventh greatest British film . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Ernest Gordon , a survivor of the POW camps and railway construction described in the movie , stated in his book Through the Valley of the Kwai recounting his experiences as a POW : `` In Pierre Boulle 's book The Bridge over the River Kwai and the film which was based on it , the impression was given that British officers not only took part in building the bridge willingly , but finished in record time to demonstrate to the enemy their superior efficiency . This was an entertaining story . But I am writing a factual account , and in justice to these men -- living and dead -- who worked on that bridge , I must make it clear that we never did so willingly . We worked at bayonet point and under bamboo lash , taking any risk to sabotage the operation whenever the opportunity arose . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In an interview that forms part of the 1969 BBC2 documentary `` Return to the River Kwai '' made by former POW John Coast , Boulle outlined the reasoning that led him to conceive the character of Nicholson . A transcript of the interview and the documentary as a whole can be found in the new edition of John Coast 's book Railroad of Death . Coast 's documentary sought to highlight the real history behind the film ( partly through getting ex-POWs to question its factual basis , for example Dr Hugh de Wardener and Lt - Col Alfred Knights ) , which angered many former POWs . The documentary itself was described by one newspaper reviewer when it was shown on Boxing Day 1974 ( The Bridge on the River Kwai had been shown on BBC1 on Christmas Day 1974 ) as `` Following the movie , this is a rerun of the antidote . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The largely fictional film plot is loosely based on the building in 1943 of one of the railway bridges over the Mae Klong -- renamed Khwae Yai in the 1960s -- at a place called Tha Ma Kham , five kilometres from the Thai town of Kanchanaburi . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The film was relatively faithful to the novel , with two major exceptions . Shears , who is a British commando officer like Warden in the novel , became an American sailor who escapes from the POW camp . Also , in the novel , the bridge is not destroyed : the train plummets into the river from a secondary charge placed by Warden , but Nicholson ( never realising `` what have I done ? '' ) does not fall onto the plunger , and the bridge suffers only minor damage . Boulle nonetheless enjoyed the film version though he disagreed with its climax . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The Japanese resented the implication in the movie that their engineers were less capable than British engineers . In fact , Japanese engineers had been surveying the route of the railway since 1937 and were highly organized . In essence , viewers disliked the `` glorification of the superiority of Western civilization '' represented in the movie , illustrated by the British being able to build a bridge that the Japanese could not . The film also contains a scene where Colonel Nicholson , while inspecting the bridge construction progress , refers to the Japanese overseeing them as `` barbarians '' . In the version of the movie edited for DVD in 2000 , the reference is overdubbed with a water splash sound . \n",

      "1) `` When You Say Nothing at All '' is a country song written by Paul Overstreet and Don Schlitz . It is among the best - known hit songs for three different performers : Keith Whitley , who took it to the top of the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart on December 24 , 1988 ; Alison Krauss , whose version was her first solo top - 10 country hit in 1995 ; and Irish pop singer Ronan Keating , whose version was his first solo single and a chart - topper in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1999 . \n",
      "\n",
      "2)When You Say Nothing at All - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "3) RCA released `` When You Say Nothing at All '' as the follow - up single to the title song of Whitley 's Do n't Close Your Eyes album . The former song already had hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart , his first chart - topper after three prior singles made the top 10 . `` When You Say Nothing at All '' entered the Hot Country Singles chart on September 17 , 1988 , at No. 61 , and gradually rose to the top , where it stayed for two weeks at the end of the year . It was the second of five consecutive chart - topping singles for Whitley , who did not live to see the last two , as he died on May 9 , 1989 of alcohol poisoning . `` Keith did a great job singin ' that song , '' co-composer Schlitz told author Tom Roland . `` He truly sang it from the heart . '' In 2004 , Whitley 's original was ranked 12th among CMT 's 100 Greatest Love Songs . It was sung by Sara Evans on the show . As of February 2015 , the song has sold 599,000 digital copies in the US after it became available for download . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) `` When You Say Nothing at All '' was released as the debut solo single by Irish singer - songwriter Ronan Keating . The song was recorded in 1999 for the soundtrack to the film Notting Hill and also appeared on Keating 's debut solo album , Ronan . The song was released on July 26 , 1999 , in the United Kingdom . It peaked at number one in the UK , Ireland , and New Zealand . In the UK , the single was certified gold . In 2003 , Keating re-recorded the song as a duet with Mexican singer Paulina Rubio , which was released in Mexico and Latin America ( excluding Brazil ) to promote Keating 's second studio album , Destination . In Brazil , Ronan chose the Brazilian singer Deborah Blando to re-record the song for the 10 Years Of Hits album exclusive for that country ( an exclusive music video was recorded for this version with Deborah ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Overstreet and Schlitz came up with `` When You Say Nothing at All '' at the end of an otherwise unproductive day . Strumming a guitar , trying to write their next song , they were coming up empty . `` As we tried to find another way to say nothing , we came up with the song , '' Overstreet later told author Ace Collins . They thought the song was OK , but nothing special . When Keith Whitley heard it , he loved it , and was not going to let it get away . Earlier , he had recorded another Overstreet - Schlitz composition that became a No. 1 hit for another artist - Randy Travis ' `` On the Other Hand . '' Whitley did not plan to let `` When You Say Nothing at All '' meet the same fate . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In 1995 , Alison Krauss covered the song with the group Union Station for a tribute album to Whitley titled Keith Whitley : A Tribute Album . The single release featured `` Charlotte 's in North Carolina , '' one of several previously - unreleased tracks sung by Whitley on the album , as the B - side . After Krauss 's cover began to receive unsolicited airplay , BNA Records , the label that had released the album , issued Krauss ' version to radio in January 1995 . That version , also featured on Krauss ' compilation Now That I 've Found You : A Collection , peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart , and a commercial single reached No. 2 on the same magazine 's Hot Country Singles Sales chart . The single 's B - side was a previously unreleased Whitley song titled `` Charlotte 's in North Carolina '' , which also appeared on the tribute album . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Krauss ' recording won the 1995 CMA award for `` Single of the Year '' . The song has been featured a couple of times in the soap opera The Young and the Restless . Krauss ' version was also used in the 1999 motion picture `` The Other Sister '' . The song has sold 468,000 digital downloads as of May 2017 . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) While Krauss ' version was on the charts , Mike Cromwell , then the production director at WMIL - FM in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , concocted a duet merging elements of Krauss ' version with Whitley 's original hit version . The `` duet '' garnered national attention , and it spread from at least Philadelphia to Albuquerque , and has been heard on radio stations in California as well . This `` duet '' was however never officially serviced to radio and has never been available commercially . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The Italian - Ukrainian - Brazilian singer Deborah Blando recorded `` When You Say Nothing at All '' in English and Portuguese for the Brazilian version of the song , which featured on the Brazilian version of Destination . The single reached the top 10 in the Latin charts . Burmese singer Zaw Paing also made a Burmese version cover . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Its success , as well as that of the album , caught Krauss by surprise . `` It 's a freak thing , '' she told a Los Angeles Times reporter in March 1995 . `` It 's kinda ticklin ' us all . We have n't had anything really chart before . At all . Is n't it funny though ? We do n't know what 's goin ' on ... The office said , ' Hey , it 's charting , ' and we 're like , ' Huh ? ' '' \n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1)Easy Rider - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Easy Rider is a 1969 American independent road drama film written by Peter Fonda , Dennis Hopper , and Terry Southern , produced by Fonda , and directed by Hopper . Fonda and Hopper played two bikers who travel through the American Southwest and South carrying the proceeds from a drug ( cocaine ) deal . The success of Easy Rider helped spark the New Hollywood era of filmmaking during the early 1970s . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Hopper and Fonda 's first collaboration was in The Trip ( 1967 ) , written by Jack Nicholson , which had themes and characters similar to those of Easy Rider . Peter Fonda had become `` an icon of the counterculture '' in The Wild Angels ( 1966 ) , where he established `` a persona he would develop further in The Trip and Easy Rider . '' The Trip also popularized LSD , while Easy Rider went on to `` celebrate 60s counterculture '' but does so `` stripped of its innocence . '' Author Katie Mills wrote that The Trip is a way point along the `` metamorphosis of the rebel road story from a Beat relic into its hippie reincarnation as Easy Rider '' , and connected Peter Fonda 's characters in those two films , along with his character in The Wild Angels , deviating from the `` formulaic biker '' persona and critiquing `` commodity - oriented filmmakers appropriating avant - garde film techniques . '' It was also a step in the transition from independent film into Hollywood 's mainstream , and while The Trip was criticized as a faux , popularized underground film made by Hollywood insiders , Easy Rider `` interrogates '' the attitude that underground film must `` remain strictly segregated from Hollywood . '' Mills also wrote that the famous acid trip scene in Easy Rider `` clearly derives from their first tentative explorations as filmmakers in The Trip . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Hopper was also said to be difficult on set . During test shooting on location in New Orleans , Hopper fought with the production 's ad hoc crew for control . At one point he entered into a physical confrontation with photographer Barry Feinstein , who was one of the camera operators for the shoot . After this turmoil , Hopper and Fonda decided to assemble a proper crew for the rest of the film . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Hopper and Fonda hosted a wrap party for the movie and then realized they had not yet shot the final campfire scene . Thus , it was shot after the bikes had already been stolen , which is why they are not visible in the background as in the other campfire scenes . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) According to Terry Southern 's biographer , Lee Hill , the part of George Hanson had been written for Southern 's friend , actor Rip Torn . When Torn met with Hopper and Fonda at a New York restaurant in early 1968 to discuss the role , Hopper began ranting about the `` rednecks '' he had encountered on his scouting trip to the South . Torn , a Texan , took exception to some of Hopper 's remarks , and the two almost came to blows , as a result of which Torn withdrew from the project . Torn was replaced by Jack Nicholson , whom Hopper had recently appeared with in Head ( along with another Easy Rider co-star , Toni Basil ) . In 1994 , Jay Leno interviewed Hopper about Easy Rider on The Tonight Show , and during the interview , Hopper alleged that Torn had pulled a knife on him during the altercation , prompting Torn to sue Hopper successfully for defamation . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In total , four former police bikes were used in the film . The 1949 , 1950 and 1952 Harley - Davidson Hydra - Glide bikes were purchased at an auction for $500 , equivalent to about $3500 in 2018 . Each bike had a backup to make sure that shooting could continue in case one of the old machines failed or got wrecked accidentally . One `` Captain America '' was demolished in the final scene , while the other three were stolen and probably taken apart before their significance as movie props became known . The demolished bike was rebuilt by Dan Haggerty and offered for auction on October 18 , 2014 by Profiles in History , a Calabasas , CA - based auction house with an estimated value of $1 million to $1.2 million . The provenance of existing Captain America motorcycles is unclear , and has been the subject of much litigation . A motorcycle on display at the EMP Museum in Seattle , Washington is identified by that organization as the original rebuilt movie prop . A replica resides at the National Motorcycle Museum in Anamosa , Iowa . Many other replicas have been built since the film 's release . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) When seeing a still of himself and Bruce Dern in The Wild Angels , Peter Fonda had the idea of a modern Western , involving two bikers travelling around the country and eventually getting shot by hillbillies . He called Dennis Hopper , and the two decided to turn that into a movie , The Loners , with Hopper directing , Fonda producing , and both starring and writing . They brought in screenwriter Terry Southern , who came up with the title Easy Rider . The film was mostly shot without a screenplay , with ad - libbed lines , and production started with only the outline and the names of the protagonists . Keeping the Western theme , Wyatt was named after Wyatt Earp and Billy after Billy the Kid . However , Southern disputed that Hopper wrote much of the script . In an interview published in 2016 ( Southern died in 1995 ) he said , `` You know if Den Hopper improvises a dozen lines and six of them survive the cutting room floor he 'll put in for screenplay credit . Now it would be almost impossible to exaggerate his contribution to the film -- but , by George , he manages to do it every time . '' According to Southern , Fonda was under contract to produce a motorcycle film with A.I.P. , which Fonda had agreed to allow Hopper to direct . According to Southern , Fonda and Hopper did n't seek screenplay credit until after the first screenings of the film , which required Southern 's agreement due to writers guild policies . Southern says he agreed out of a sense of camaraderie , and that Hopper later took credit for the entire script . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The motorcycles for the film , based on hardtail frames and panhead engines , were designed and built by two African - American chopper builders -- Cliff Vaughs and Ben Hardy -- following ideas of Peter Fonda , and handled by Tex Hall and Dan Haggerty during shooting . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The filming budget of Easy Rider was $360,000 to $400,000 . Peter Fonda said that on top this , he personally paid for the costs of travel and lodging for the crew , saying , `` Everybody was taking my credit cards and would pay for all the hotels , the food , the gas , everything with Diner 's Club '' . Laszlo Kovacs said that an additional $1 million , `` about three times the budget for shooting the rest of the film '' was spent licensing music that was added during the editing . \n",

      "2) The transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 ended the colony 's ties to the Commonwealth through the United Kingdom . The government of Hong Kong , as a special administrative region of China , did not pursue membership . Hong Kong has nevertheless continued to participate in some of the organisations of the Commonwealth family , such as the Commonwealth Lawyers Association ( hosted the Commonwealth Lawyers Conference in 1983 and 2009 ) , the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association ( and the Westminster Seminar on Parliamentary Practice and Procedures ) , the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Besides the Commonwealth Games , other sporting competitions are organised on a Commonwealth basis , through championship tournaments such as the Commonwealth Taekwondo Championships , Commonwealth Fencing Championships , Commonwealth Judo Championships , Commonwealth Rowing Championships , Commonwealth Sailing Championships , Commonwealth Shooting Championships and Commonwealth Pool Lifesaving Championships . The Commonwealth Boxing Council has long maintained Commonwealth titles for the best boxers in the Commonwealth . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Commonwealth of Nations ( formerly the British Commonwealth ) , also known as simply the Commonwealth , is an intergovernmental organisation of 52 member states that are mostly former territories of the British Empire . The Commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of the member states , organised through the Commonwealth Secretariat and non-governmental organisations , organised through the Commonwealth Foundation . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The Commonwealth dates back to the mid-20th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self - governance of its territories . It was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949 , which established the member states as `` free and equal '' . The symbol of this free association is Queen Elizabeth II who is the Head of the Commonwealth , but this role does not carry any power with it . While there are over 31 republics and five monarchies who have a different monarch , the Queen is the ceremonial head of state and reigning constitutional monarch of 16 members of the Commonwealth , known as Commonwealth realms but retains a crown legally distinct from the other realms with the position as monarch being separate from that of Head of the Commonwealth . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Due to their shared constitutional histories , several countries in the Commonwealth have similar legal and political systems . The Commonwealth requires its members to be functioning democracies that respect human rights and the rule of law . Most Commonwealth countries have the bicameral Westminster system of parliamentary democracy . The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association facilitates co-operation between legislatures across the Commonwealth , and the Commonwealth Local Government Forum promotes good governance amongst local government officials . Most Commonwealth members use common law , modelled on English law . The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the supreme court of 14 Commonwealth members . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) After World War II ended , the British Empire was gradually dismantled . Most of its components have become independent countries , whether Commonwealth realms or republics , and members of the Commonwealth . There remain the 14 mainly self - governing British overseas territories which retain some political association with the United Kingdom . In April 1949 , following the London Declaration , the word `` British '' was dropped from the title of the Commonwealth to reflect its changing nature . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In recognition of their shared heritage and culture , Commonwealth countries are not considered to be `` foreign '' to each other , although the technical extent of this concept varies in different countries . For example , in Australia , for the purpose of considering certain constitutional and legal provisions no distinction is made between Commonwealth and foreign countries : in the High Court case of Sue v Hill , other Commonwealth countries were held to be foreign powers ; similarly , in Nolan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs , the nationals of other Commonwealth realms were held to be ' aliens ' . Nevertheless , the closer association amongst Commonwealth countries is reflected at least in the diplomatic protocols of the Commonwealth countries . For example , when engaging bilaterally with one another , Commonwealth governments exchange high commissioners instead of ambassadors . Between two Commonwealth realms , they represent the head of government rather than the head of state . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Other eligible applicants could be any of the remaining inhabited British overseas territories , Crown dependencies , Australian external territories and the Associated States of New Zealand if they become fully independent . Many such jurisdictions are already directly represented within the Commonwealth , particularly through the Commonwealth Family . There are also former British possessions that have not become independent , for example , Hong Kong , which still participates in some of the institutions within the Commonwealth Family . All three Crown dependencies regard the existing situation as unsatisfactory and have lobbied for change . The States of Jersey have called on the UK Foreign Secretary to request that the Commonwealth Heads of Government `` consider granting associate membership to Jersey and the other Crown Dependencies as well as any other territories at a similarly advanced stage of autonomy '' . Jersey has proposed that it be accorded `` self - representation in all Commonwealth meetings ; full participation in debates and procedures , with a right to speak where relevant and the opportunity to enter into discussions with those who are full members ; and no right to vote in the Ministerial or Heads of Government meetings , which is reserved for full members '' . The States of Guernsey and the Government of the Isle of Man have made calls of a similar nature for a more integrated relationship with the Commonwealth , including more direct representation and enhanced participation in Commonwealth organisations and meetings , including Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings . The Chief Minister of the Isle of Man has said : `` A closer connection with the Commonwealth itself would be a welcome further development of the Island 's international relationships '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Under the formula of the London Declaration , Queen Elizabeth II is the Head of the Commonwealth , a title that is by law a part of Elizabeth 's royal titles in each of the Commonwealth realms , the 16 members of the Commonwealth that recognise the Queen as their monarch . However , when the monarch dies , the successor to the crown does not automatically become Head of the Commonwealth . The position is symbolic , representing the free association of independent members , the majority of which ( 31 ) are republics , and five have monarchs of different royal houses ( Brunei , Lesotho , Malaysia , Swaziland , and Tonga ) . \n",

      "\u001b[1mQuestion 63: where can pulse be felt in the body ?\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> In medicine , a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat by trained fingertips . The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body , such as at the neck ( carotid artery ) , wrist ( radial artery ) , at the groin ( femoral artery ) , behind the knee ( popliteal artery ) , near the ankle joint ( posterior tibial artery ) , and on foot ( dorsalis pedis artery ) . Pulse ( or the count of arterial pulse per minute ) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate . The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by auscultation , traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute . The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers . This has a reason : the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure , the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure , and the finger most distal to the heart ( usually the ring finger ) is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches ( superficial and deep ) . The study of the pulse is known as sphygmology . </P>\n",

      "4) In medicine , a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat by trained fingertips . The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body , such as at the neck ( carotid artery ) , wrist ( radial artery ) , at the groin ( femoral artery ) , behind the knee ( popliteal artery ) , near the ankle joint ( posterior tibial artery ) , and on foot ( dorsalis pedis artery ) .

The study of the pulse is known as sphygmology . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The heart rate may be greater or lesser than the pulse rate depending upon physiologic demand . In this case , the heart rate is determined by auscultation or audible sounds at the heart apex , in which case it is not the pulse . The pulse deficit ( difference between heart beats and pulsations at the periphery ) is determined by simultaneous palpation at the radial artery and auscultation at the PMI , near the heart apex . It may be present in case of premature beats or atrial fibrillation . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) A normal pulse is regular in rhythm and force . An irregular pulse may be due to sinus arrhythmia , ectopic beats , atrial fibrillation , paroxysmal atrial tachycardia , atrial flutter , partial heart block etc . Intermittent dropping out of beats at pulse is called `` intermittent pulse '' . Examples of regular intermittent ( regularly irregular ) pulse include pulsus bigeminus , second - degree atrioventricular block . An example of irregular intermittent ( irregularly irregular ) pulse is atrial fibrillation . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) It corresponds to diastolic blood pressure . A low tension pulse ( pulsus mollis ) , the vessel is soft or impalpable between beats . In high tension pulse ( pulsus durus ) , vessels feel rigid even between pulse beats . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Claudius Galen was perhaps the first physiologist to describe the pulse . The pulse is an expedient tactile method of determination of systolic blood pressure to a trained observer . Diastolic blood pressure is non-palpable and unobservable by tactile methods , occurring between heartbeats . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) A form or contour of a pulse is palpatiory estimation of arteriogram . A quickly rising and quickly falling pulse ( pulsus celer ) is seen in aortic regurgitation . A slow rising and slowly falling pulse ( pulsus tardus ) is seen in aortic stenosis . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Although the pulse can be felt in multiple places in the head , people should not normally hear their heartbeats within the head . This is called pulsatile tinnitus , and it can indicate several medical disorders . \n",

      "2) I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang ! is a book written by Robert Elliott Burns in 1932 and published by Grosset & Dunlap . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The book tells the story of Burns ' imprisonment on a chain gang in Georgia in the 1920s , his subsequent escape , and the furor that developed . The story was first published in January 1932 , serialized in True Detective Mysteries magazine . Later that year , Burns ' story was made into the motion picture I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang , starring Paul Muni . The book and movie were both credited with helping to reform deplorable conditions on Deep South chain gangs under Governor Ellis Arnall in 1943 . \n",

      "3) The Tacoma School District purchased the gutted building on February 19 , 1904 , with the intent of turning it into a high school . The redesign and later renovations were planned by the school 's architect , Frederick Heath . It was repaired and renovated into a school . Despite its extraordinary locale and design , on the inside it looks , feels , and operates like a typical American high school . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Stadium High School is a public high school in Tacoma , Washington , and a historic landmark . It is part of Tacoma Public Schools , or Tacoma School District No. 10 and is located in the Stadium District , near downtown Tacoma . The original building burned to a shell in 1898 while it was still a partially constructed hotel designed by Hewitt & Hewitt that was being used for storage . It was reconstructed for use as a school beginning in 1906 according to designs by Frederick Heath , and a `` bowl '' stadium was added later in 1910 . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The centennial celebration of Stadium High School was held on September 16 , 2006 . The celebration was attended by 3299 alumni , setting a Guinness World Record for the largest recorded school reunion . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In the years of 2006 and 2007 , no one in Tacoma submitted a float , a requirement for participation in the festival . The festival board waived the requirement , but in 2008 warned that if no group within Tacoma School District boundaries presented a float , Tacoma and its students , including the Royal Court program , would be barred from participation in the 2009 parade . In response , the Stadium High School Environmental Club decided to build a float , ensuring Stadium and other area schools inclusion in the Daffodil Festival for 2009 . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The reconstructed building opened on September 10 , 1906 , as Tacoma High School . Seven years later , the name was changed to reference the adjacent Stadium Bowl . Later additions included a circular lunchroom , an underground swimming pool , a science and industrial arts complex , a gymnasium , and a multi-story parking lot structure with tennis courts on the roof . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In 2005 - 2006 the school underwent a major renovation , seismic upgrade , historical restoration , and expansion . Bassetti Architects were the design architects , and Merrit Pardini Architects ( later Krei Architecture ) were the architects of record for this work . During the renovation , students were temporarily relocated to the old site of Mount Tahoma High School in the south end , just over 7 miles ( 11 km ) away . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Annie Jeong of Stadium was crowned Daffodil queen 2010 . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The main building was constructed by architects Hewitt and Hewitt for the Northern Pacific Railroad Company and the Tacoma Land Company at what was then known as Blackwell Point . Construction began in 1891 with the intention of building a luxury hotel resembling a French château . The Panic of 1893 , however , brought construction to an abrupt halt when the Northern Pacific was faced with financial disaster . The unfinished building became a storage facility , with much of the building materials still inside . On October 11 , 1898 , the building was gutted by a massive fire . The walls remained standing , and the Northern Pacific began to dismantle the structure , removing some 40,000 bricks that would be used to construct still - existing train stations in Missoula , Montana , and Wallace , Idaho . \n",

      "2) The WWE Championship is a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship in WWE , currently on the SmackDown brand . It is the first world title established in WWE , having been introduced in 1963 as the World Wide Wrestling Federation ( WWWF ) World Heavyweight Championship . The promotion was renamed World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) in 1979 and ended its affiliation with the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) in 1983 , with the title also renamed to reflect the changes . In 2001 , it was unified with the World Championship ( formerly the WCW World Heavyweight Championship ) following the WWF 's buyout of World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) and became the Undisputed WWF Championship . In 2002 , the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) and split its roster into two brands , Raw and SmackDown . The title , now renamed WWE Championship , was then designated to the SmackDown brand while WWE established an alternate world title known as the World Heavyweight Championship for the Raw brand . A third alternate world title , the ECW World Heavyweight Championship , was reactivated for the ECW brand in 2006 . It was vacated and decommissioned when the ECW brand disbanded in 2010 . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) When WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena at the TLC pay - per - view on December 15 , 2013 , the World Heavyweight Championship was unified with the WWE Championship , resulting in the retiring of the former and the renaming of the latter to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship . On June 27 , 2016 , the name was shortened back to the WWE Championship before assuming the WWE World Championship name on July 26 , when the brand extension returned . It became designated to the SmackDown brand and WWE again established an alternate world title known as the WWE Universal Championship for the Raw brand . In December 2016 , WWE again shortened the title 's name back to WWE Championship . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The championship is generally contested in professional wrestling matches , in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition . Some reigns were held by champions using a ring name , while others use their real name . The first champion was Buddy Rogers , who won the championship in 1963 . The champion with the single longest reign is Bruno Sammartino with a reign of 2,803 days , while the record for longest combined reign is also held by Sammartino at 4,040 . The current champion is AJ Styles , who is in his second reign . He won the championship by defeating Jinder Mahal on SmackDown in Manchester , England on November 7 , 2017 . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Overall , there have been 50 different official champions , with John Cena having the most reigns at thirteen . Seven men in history have held the championship for a continuous reign of one year ( 365 days ) or more : Bruno Sammartino ( who achieved the feat on two separate occasions ) , Pedro Morales , Bob Backlund , Hulk Hogan , Randy Savage , John Cena , and CM Punk . \n",

It began on Friday , 2 April 1982 , when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands ( and , the following day , South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands ) in an attempt to establish the sovereignty it had claimed over them . On 5 April , the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands .

      "\n",
      "3) Chile gave support to the UK in the form of intelligence about the Argentine military and early warning intelligence on Argentine air movements . Throughout the war , Argentina was afraid of a Chilean military intervention in Patagonia and kept some of its best mountain regiments away from the Falklands near the Chilean border as a precaution . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The ongoing tension between the two countries over the islands increased on 19 March when a group of Argentine scrap metal merchants ( actually infiltrated by Argentine marines ) raised the Argentine flag at South Georgia Island , an act that would later be seen as the first offensive action in the war . The Royal Navy ice patrol vessel HMS Endurance was dispatched from Stanley to South Georgia on the 25th in response . The Argentine military junta , suspecting that the UK would reinforce its South Atlantic Forces , ordered the invasion of the Falkland Islands to be brought forward to 2 April . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The UK was initially taken by surprise by the Argentine attack on the South Atlantic islands , despite repeated warnings by Royal Navy captain Nicholas Barker and others . Barker believed that Defence Secretary John Nott 's 1981 review ( in which Nott described plans to withdraw the Endurance , the UK 's only naval presence in the South Atlantic ) had sent a signal to the Argentines that the UK was unwilling , and would soon be unable , to defend its territories and subjects in the Falklands . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Falklands had only three airfields . The longest and only paved runway was at the capital , Stanley , and even that was too short to support fast jets ( although an arrestor gear was fitted in April to support Skyhawks ) . Therefore , the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland , severely hampering their efforts at forward staging , combat air patrols , and close air support over the islands . The effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft was low , and they were later compelled to overfly British forces in any attempt to attack the islands . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in Madrid , at which the two governments issued a joint statement . No change in either country 's position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit . In 1994 , Argentina 's claim to the territories was added to its constitution . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Many of the Argentine dead are buried in the Argentine Military Cemetery west of the Darwin Settlement . The government of Argentina declined an offer by the UK to have the bodies repatriated to the mainland . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The Argentine Navy used their last AM39 Exocet missile attempting to attack HMS Invincible on 30 May . There are Argentine claims that the missile struck ; however , the British have denied this , some citing that HMS Avenger shot it down . When Invincible returned to the UK after the war , she showed no signs of missile damage . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The first major Argentine strike force comprised 36 aircraft ( A-4 Skyhawks , IAI Daggers , English Electric Canberras , and Mirage III escorts ) , and was sent on 1 May , in the belief that the British invasion was imminent or landings had already taken place . Only a section of Grupo 6 ( flying IAI Dagger aircraft ) found ships , which were firing at Argentine defences near the islands . The Daggers managed to attack the ships and return safely . This greatly boosted morale of the Argentine pilots , who now knew they could survive an attack against modern warships , protected by radar ground clutter from the Islands and by using a late pop up profile . Meanwhile , other Argentine aircraft were intercepted by BAE Sea Harriers operating from HMS Invincible . A Dagger and a Canberra were shot down . \n",

      "1)Orbit of the Moon - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The Moon 's elongation is its angular distance east of the Sun at any time . At new moon , it is zero and the Moon is said to be in conjunction . At full moon , the elongation is 180 ° and it is said to be in opposition . In both cases , the Moon is in syzygy , that is , the Sun , Moon and Earth are nearly aligned . When elongation is either 90 ° or 270 ° , the Moon is said to be in quadrature . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) In representations of the Solar System , it is common to draw the trajectory of Earth from the point of view of the Sun , and the trajectory of the Moon from the point of view of Earth . This could give the impression that the Moon orbits Earth in such a way that sometimes it goes backwards when viewed from the Sun 's perspective . Because the orbital velocity of the Moon around Earth ( 1 km / s ) is small compared to the orbital velocity of Earth about the Sun ( 30 km / s ) , this never happens . There are no rearward loops in the Moon 's solar orbit . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) In effect , this means that the `` tropical year '' on the moon is only 347 days long . This is called the draconic year or eclipse year . The `` seasons '' on the moon fit into this period . For about half of this draconic year , the sun is north of the lunar equator ( but at most 1.543 ° ) , and for the other half , it is south of the lunar equator . Obviously , the effect of these seasons is minor compared to the difference between lunar night and lunar day . At the lunar poles , instead of usual lunar days and nights of about 15 Earth days , the sun will be `` up '' for 173 days as it will be `` down '' ; polar sunrise and sunset takes 18 days each year . `` Up '' here means that the centre of the sun is above the horizon . Lunar polar sunrises and sunsets occur around the time of eclipses ( solar or lunar ) . For example , at the Solar eclipse of March 9 , 2016 , the moon was near its descending node , and the sun was near the point in the sky where the equator of the moon crosses the ecliptic . When the sun reaches that point , the centre of the sun sets at the lunar north pole and rises at the lunar south pole . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The Moon is in synchronous rotation , meaning that it keeps the same face toward Earth at all times . This synchronous rotation is only true on average , because the Moon 's orbit has a definite eccentricity . As a result , the angular velocity of the Moon varies as it orbits Earth and hence is not always equal to the Moon 's rotational velocity . When the Moon is at its perigee , its rotation is slower than its orbital motion , and this allows us to see up to eight degrees of longitude of its eastern ( right ) far side . Conversely , when the Moon reaches its apogee , its rotation is faster than its orbital motion and this reveals eight degrees of longitude of its western ( left ) far side . This is referred to as longitudinal libration . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Moon is gradually receding from Earth into a higher orbit , and calculations suggest that this would continue for about 50 billion years . By that time , Earth and the Moon would be in a mutual spin -- orbit resonance or tidal locking , in which the Moon will orbit Earth in about 47 days ( currently 27 days ) , and both the Moon and Earth would rotate around their axes in the same time , always facing each other with the same side . This has already happened to the Moon -- the same side always faces Earth -- and is also slowly happening to the Earth . However , the slowdown of Earth 's rotation is not occurring fast enough for the rotation to lengthen to a month before other effects change the situation : approximately 2.3 billion years from now , the increase of the Sun 's radiation will have caused Earth 's oceans to evaporate , removing the bulk of the tidal friction and acceleration . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Considering the Earth -- Moon system as a binary planet , its centre of gravity is within Earth , about 4,624 km ( 2,873 mi ) or 72.6 % of the Earth 's radius from the centre of the Earth . This centre of gravity remains on the line between the centres of the Earth and Moon as the Earth completes its diurnal rotation . The path of the Earth -- Moon system in its solar orbit is defined as the movement of this mutual centre of gravity around the sun . Consequently , Earth 's centre veers inside and outside the solar orbital path during each synodic month as the Moon moves in its orbit around the common centre of gravity . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The Sun 's gravitational effect on the Moon is more than twice that of Earth 's on the Moon ; consequently , the Moon 's trajectory is always convex ( as seen when looking Sunward at the entire Sun -- Earth -- Moon system from a great distance outside Earth -- Moon solar orbit ) , and is nowhere concave ( from the same perspective ) or looped . That is , the region enclosed by the Moon 's orbit of the Sun is a convex set . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Because of the inclination of the moon 's orbit with respect to the earth 's equator , the moon is above the horizon at the North and South Pole for almost two weeks every month , even though the sun is below the horizon for six months at a time . The period from moonrise to moonrise at the poles is a tropical month , about 27.3 days , quite close to the sidereal period . When the sun is the furthest below the horizon ( winter solstice ) , the moon will be full when it is at its highest point . When the moon is in Gemini it will be above the horizon at the North Pole , and when it is in Sagittarius it will be up at the South Pole . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Because the lunar orbit is also inclined to Earth 's ecliptic plane by 5.1 ° , the rotational axis of the Moon seems to rotate towards and away from Earth during one complete orbit . This is referred to as latitudinal libration , which allows one to see almost 7 ° of latitude beyond the pole on the far side . Finally , because the Moon is only about 60 Earth radii away from Earth 's centre of mass , an observer at the equator who observes the Moon throughout the night moves laterally by one Earth diameter . This gives rise to a diurnal libration , which allows one to view an additional one degree 's worth of lunar longitude . For the same reason , observers at both of Earth 's geographical poles would be able to see one additional degree 's worth of libration in latitude . \n",

      "1)Vegas Golden Knights - Wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The team 's name includes `` Knights '' as a homage to the Black Knights of the United States Military Academy , Foley 's alma mater , and because knights were , according to Foley , `` the epitome of the warrior class '' . Foley had hoped to name his team the Black Knights , but dropped that plan after encountering resistance from federal officials . Foley was unable to call the team the `` Vegas Knights '' due to the London Knights owning the `` Knights '' name in Canada . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) On May 16 , 2017 , the Golden Knights entered a multi-year affiliation agreement with a minor league team , the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League . Like most NHL - AHL affiliation arrangements , the Golden Knights are able to transfer players to and from the Wolves . Although the Wolves are the Golden Knights affiliate , the two teams do not share the same ownership . In addition to the Wolves , the Golden Knights were affiliated with the Quad City Mallards of the ECHL for the 2017 -- 18 season , however , the Mallards ceased operations after the one season . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Vegas Golden Knights are a professional ice hockey team based in the Las Vegas metropolitan area . The team began play in the 2017 -- 18 NHL season , and is a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . The team is owned by Black Knight Sports & Entertainment , a consortium led by Bill Foley and the Maloof family . The team plays its home games at T - Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise , Nevada . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The United States Army initially expressed concern after the Golden Knights ' name was announced , because their parachute team uses the same nickname . The Army later disputed the trademark and colors of the team during its first season , to which the team responded : `` We are not aware of a single complaint from anyone attending our games that they were expecting to see the parachute team and not a professional hockey game . '' An objection was also raised by the College of Saint Rose because its sports teams use the same name ; the Vegas team 's initial trademark application was denied as a result , but was later approved on appeal . The team did clear the name with Clarkson University , which also uses the name Golden Knights . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) This is a complete list of the seasons completed by the Golden Knights . For the full season - by - season history , see List of Vegas Golden Knights seasons . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) At the league owners ' meeting on June 22 , 2016 , in Las Vegas , the Las Vegas expansion bid was approved by a unanimous vote , with play to begin in the 2017 -- 18 NHL season . The team became the first major professional sports franchise to be based in Las Vegas , and the first NHL expansion team since 2000 . Foley committed to pay the league 's $500 million expansion fee and began the process of hiring the team 's principal staff and determining its official identity . Foley announced that former Washington Capitals general manager George McPhee would be the franchise 's first general manager . On November 22 , 2016 , the name was revealed as the Vegas Golden Knights . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The NHL has had a presence in Las Vegas since 1991 , when an outdoor game was held in Las Vegas , with the Los Angeles Kings facing the New York Rangers outside Caesars Palace in a preseason exhibition game . The city has since hosted the Frozen Fury , a preseason competition between the Los Angeles Kings and the Colorado Avalanche , and the NHL Awards ceremonies have been held in Las Vegas since 2009 . In 2009 , the media speculated about a plan involving Hollywood producer Jerry Bruckheimer to move the Phoenix Coyotes to Nevada . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) On April 11 , the franchise won its first playoff game in a 1 -- 0 victory over the Los Angeles Kings in the first game of the series . Six days later on April 17 , the franchise earned their first playoff series win against the Kings , winning the fourth game by a 1 -- 0 score , which also became their first playoff series sweep . The Knights became the first team in NHL history to sweep their first playoff series in their inaugural season . On May 6 , 2018 , the Golden Knights defeated the San Jose Sharks four - games - to - two , becoming the third team in NHL history to win multiple playoff series in their inaugural season , and advanced to the Western Conference Finals . On May 20 , Vegas defeated the Winnipeg Jets to win the Western Conference Finals in five games , becoming the third NHL team to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals in its inaugural season , after the Toronto Arenas in 1918 and the St. Louis Blues in 1968 . The Golden Knights would lose the Stanley Cup Finals to the Washington Capitals in five games . The Golden Knights are the first , and to date only , true expansion team to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals in their inaugural season . The Golden Knights are additionally the fastest true expansion team to advance to the finals in the history of all four major professional leagues in North America . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The Golden Knights ' mascot is a Gila monster named Chance . He was unveiled at the team 's second home game on October 13 , 2017 . The team opted against using a knight for a mascot because it found that knight mascots used by other teams were not very child - friendly . \n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) This is related to the rhetorical device of hendiadys , where one concept is expressed through the use of two descriptive words or phrases . For example , `` goblets and gold '' meaning wealth , or `` this day and age '' meaning the present time . Superficially these expressions may seem tautological , but they are stylistically sound because the repeated meaning is just a way to emphasize the same idea . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) In literary criticism and rhetoric , a tautology is a statement which repeats the same idea , using near - synonymous morphemes , words , or phrases , that is , `` saying the same thing twice '' . Tautology and pleonasm are not consistently differentiated in the literature . \n",
      "\n",
      "3)Tautology ( language ) - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Parallelism is not tautology , but rather a particular stylistic device . Much Old Testament poetry is based on parallelism : the same thing said twice , but in slightly different ways ( Fowler puts it as pleonasm ) . However , modern biblical study emphasizes that there are subtle distinctions and developments between the two lines , such that they are usually not truly the `` same thing . '' Parallelism can be found wherever there is poetry in the Bible : Psalms , the Books of the Prophets , and in other areas as well . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The word was coined in Hellenistic Greek from ταὐτός ' the same plus λόγος ' word / idea '. , and transmitted through 3rd - century Latin tautologia and French tautologie . It first appears in English in the 16th century . The use in the term logical tautology was introduced in English by Wittgenstein in 1919 , perhaps following Auguste Comte 's usage in 1835 . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Sometimes logical tautologies like `` Boys will be boys '' are conflated with language tautologies , but in general , a rhetorical tautology is not inherently true . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The use of tautologies is , however , usually unintentional . For example , the phrases `` mental telepathy '' , `` planned conspiracies '' , and `` small dwarfs '' imply that there are such things as `` physical telepathy , spontaneous conspiracies , and giant dwarfs . '' ) \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Like pleonasm , it is often considered a fault of style when unintentional . On the other hand , an intentional repetition may be an effective way to emphasize a thought , or help the listener or reader understand a point . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Intentional repetition of meaning intends to amplify or emphasize a particular , usually significant , fact about what is being discussed . For example , a gift is , by definition , free of charge ; using the phrase `` free gift '' might emphasize that there are no hidden conditions or fine print , be it the expectation of money or reciprocation , or that the gift is being given by volition . \n",

      "1)High - and low - level - Wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) High - level and low - level are typically terms used to classify , describe and point to specific goals of a systematic operation , though its uses also vary depending on the context - such as use in computer science versus business administration . In general , high - level is used to describe operations that are more abstract in nature , where overall goals and systemic features are typically more concerned with the wider , macro system as a whole . Alternatively , a low - level description is one that describes more specific individual components of a systematic operation , focusing on the details of rudimentary micro functions rather than macro , complex processes . Low - level classification is typically more concerned with individual components within the system and how they operate . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Due to the nature of complex systems , the high - level description will often be completely different from the low level one . For example , there are features to an ant colony that are not features of any individual ant ; features of the human mind that are not known to be descriptive of individual neurons in the brain , features of oceans which are not features of any individual water molecule , and features to a human personality that are not features of any cell in a body . The descriptions of these differ depending at what level they are studied . Features which emerge only at a high level of description are known as epiphenomena . \n",

      "1)The Passion of the Christ - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) According to Mel Gibson , the primary source material for The Passion of the Christ is the four canonical Gospel narratives of Christ 's passion . The film includes a trial of Jesus at Herod 's court , which is only found in the Gospel of Luke . Many of the utterances from Jesus in the film can not be directly sourced to the Gospel and are part of a wider Christian narrative . The film also draws from other parts of the New Testament . The line spoken by Jesus in the film , `` I make all things new , '' is found in the Book of Revelation . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Certain elements of The Passion of the Christ do not have precedent in earlier depictions of the Passion . In the Garden of Gethsemane scene at the beginning of the movie , Satan appears and attempts to distract Jesus while he is praying . Jesus then crushes a serpent beneath his heel ( a reference to the protoevangelium , Genesis 3 : 15 -- a prophecy of Messiah ) ; this does not occur in any of the gospels . In another example , Judas Iscariot is tormented by children who appear as demons to him . The film gives focus to the fragile relationship of Tiberius Caesar with Pontius Pilate through Pilate 's discussion with his wife about imperial orders to avert further Judean revolts . The movie clearly identifies Simon of Cyrene as Jewish , although the Synoptic Gospels provide only his name and place of origin . In the film , a Roman soldier derides Simon ( who helps Jesus bear the cross ) by derisively calling him Jew . In contrast , Simon is described as a pagan in The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ . Another major difference that passes most unnoticed is the INRI titulus on Christ 's cross which is written only in two languages ( however occupying three lines ) , instead of three as mentioned in the Gospels . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) In June 2016 , it was announced that Mel Gibson is working on a sequel to The Passion of the Christ , focusing on the resurrection of Jesus . The screenwriter is Randall Wallace , who wrote the screenplay for Braveheart ( 1995 ) . Gibson has expressed an interest in directing the film . He also said that the film will come out in a few years since it is a big project . In November 2016 , Gibson confirmed that the title of the sequel would be Resurrection and implied that part of the movie would be taking place in hell , stating that the film would explore what happened in the three - day period between the death of Jesus and his return . He also revealed that the film would probably be about three years away , because of its massive undertaking . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The film also refers to the Tanakh . The film begins with an epigraph from the Fourth Song of the Suffering Servant from Isaiah . In the opening scene set in the Garden of Gethsemane , Jesus crushes a serpent 's head in direct visual allusion to Genesis 3 : 15 . Throughout the film , Jesus quotes from the Psalms , beyond the instances recorded in the New Testament . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Many of the depictions in the film deliberately mirror traditional representations of the Passion in art . For example , the fourteen Stations of the Cross are central to the depiction of the Via Dolorosa in The Passion of the Christ . All the stations are portrayed except for the eighth station ( Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem , a deleted scene on the DVD ) and the fourteenth station ( Jesus is laid in the tomb ) . Gibson was also visually inspired by the representation of Jesus on the Shroud of Turin . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Other scenes unique to the film include the one in which the crucified thief who taunted Christ has his eye pecked out by a crow ( in some Catholic iconography a crow is represented above the bad thief and a dove or angel above the good thief ) and the flashback of Christ at an earlier time building an elevated , four - legged table for a Roman . The scene of Satan carrying a demonic baby during Christ 's flogging has been construed as a perversion of traditional depictions of the Madonna and Child , and also as a representation of Satan and the Antichrist . Gibson described this scene : \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Caiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate to be condemned to death , but after questioning Jesus and finding no fault , a sympathetic Pilate instead relays him to the court of Herod Antipas , as Jesus is from Antipas ' ruling town of Nazareth , Galilee . After Jesus is again found not guilty and returned , Pilate offers the crowd options for either him to chastise Jesus , or release him . He then attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples ' choice , between Jesus and a violent criminal Barabbas . To his dismay and anger , the crowd demands to have Barabbas freed and Jesus killed . In an attempt to appease the moment , Pilate orders that he simply be punished but not killed . Jesus is brutally scourged , abused , and mocked by the Roman guards as `` king of the Jews '' with a crown of thorns until Abenader , the general , angrily stops them . However , Caiaphas , with the crowds ' verbal backing , continues to demand that Jesus be crucified as a heretic and Barabbas released . Admonished , Pilate washes his hands , takes no responsibility of the incident , and reluctantly orders Jesus ' crucifixion . During the course of events , Satan watches Jesus ' bloody sufferings with great interest . A dismayed Pilate watches the march , while his wife Claudia , who knows of Jesus ' status as a holy man , comforts him . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The movie is 126 minutes long , and I would guess that at least 100 of those minutes , maybe more , are concerned specifically and graphically with the details of the torture and death of Jesus . This is the most violent film I have ever seen . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The conflation of Mary Magdalene with the adulteress saved from stoning by Jesus has some precedent in tradition , and according to the director was done for dramatic reasons . The names of some characters in the film are traditional and extra-Scriptural , such as the thieves crucified alongside the Christ , Dismas and Gesmas ( also Gestas ) . \n",

      "3) Chelsea as a Premier League team entered in the third round of the FA Cup against Championship club Norwich City on 7 January at Carrow Road , which ended with a 0 -- 0 draw . The replay was held 11 days later and was a 1 -- 1 draw with goals from Michy Batshuayi in the 55th minute and Jamal Lewis in the 90th minute , going to extra time and then a penalty shootout that Chelsea won 5 -- 3 . In the fourth round , they met Premier League opposition Newcastle United at Stamford Bridge , and won 3 -- 0 with two goals from Batshuayi and a one from Marcos Alonso . In the fifth round , Chelsea faced another Championship team , Hull City , and won 4 -- 0 with Willian ( 2 ) , Pedro and Olivier Giroud scoring . In the quarter - finals , they visited the King Power Stadium to face Leicester City , where a goal for Chelsea from Álvaro Morata and a Leicester equaliser from Jamie Vardy took the game to extra time , in which substitute Pedro came off the bench and scored the winning goal to take Chelsea to the semi-finals at Wembley to face Southampton . In that match , goals from both strikers Giroud and Morata were enough to see off Southampton 2 -- 0 to bring Chelsea back to the FA Cup Final for the second successive season . Chelsea are seeking their eighth FA Cup triumph . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Manchester United , also of the Premier League , entered in the third round and were drawn at home against Championship side Derby County and won 2 -- 0 with goals from Jesse Lingard and Romelu Lukaku . In the next round , they were drawn against League Two club Yeovil Town at Huish Park and won 4 -- 0 with goals from Marcus Rashford , Ander Herrera , Jesse Lingard and Lukaku . In the fifth round , Manchester United were drawn with fellow Premier League side Huddersfield Town away at Kirklees Stadium , and Lukaku scored both goals in a 2 -- 0 win . In the quarter - finals , they played Premier League Brighton & Hove Albion at Old Trafford , and progressed due to goals by Lukaku and Nemanja Matić . In the semi-final at Wembley Stadium against Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur , Manchester United reached their 20th final after coming from behind to win 2 -- 1 with goals from Alexis Sánchez and Herrera . Manchester United were looking to match Arsenal 's record of 13 FA Cup wins . \n",

      "\n",
      "6) The teams had met twice before in the FA Cup Final , winning one each between them . The first was in 1994 , which Manchester United won 4 -- 0 , and most recently in 2007 , when Chelsea -- then managed by current Manchester United boss José Mourinho -- won 1 -- 0 after extra time . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) As winners , Chelsea qualified for the group stage of the 2018 -- 19 UEFA Europa League , although they had qualified for that phase already via their league position . Chelsea also earned the right to play 2017 -- 18 Premier League champions Manchester City for the 2018 FA Community Shield . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Tributes for former Chelsea and Manchester United midfielder Ray Wilkins , who died on 4 April , were held before the match on the hoardings and the screens in the stadium , as well as a feature in the match programme . Wilkins won the FA Cup with both sides , scoring for United in the initial 1983 FA Cup Final tie , and winning it three times as assistant manager of Chelsea -- in 2000 , 2009 and 2010 . The traditional performance of the hymn , `` Abide with Me '' was performed by the choir of the Royal Air Force and 14 individual fans of 14 different clubs with a flypast by 3 RAF Typhoons .

      "\n",
      "6) A Midsummer Night 's Dream is a comedy written by William Shakespeare in 1595 / 96 . It portrays the events surrounding the marriage of Theseus , the Duke of Athens , to Hippolyta , the former queen of the Amazons . These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors ( the mechanicals ) who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set . The play is one of Shakespeare 's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world . \n",

      "7) Henry Meynell Rheam : Titania welcoming her fairy brethren \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Hermia and Lysander have escaped to the same forest in hopes of eloping . Helena , desperate to reclaim Demetrius 's love , tells Demetrius about the plan and he follows them in hopes of killing Lysander . Helena continually makes advances towards Demetrius , promising to love him more than Hermia . However , he rebuffs her with cruel insults against her . Observing this , Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man . Instead , Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius , not having actually seen either before , and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander . Helena , coming across him , wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep . Upon this happening , Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena . Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia and is enraged . When Demetrius goes to sleep , Oberon sends Puck to get Helena while he charms Demetrius ' eyes . Upon waking up , he sees Helena . Now , both men are in pursuit of Helena . However , she is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her , as neither loved her originally . Hermia is at a loss to see why her lover has abandoned her , and accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her . The four quarrel with each other until Lysander and Demetrius become so enraged that they seek a place to duel to prove whose love for Helena is the greater . Oberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from Lysander so Lysander can return to love Hermia , while Demetrius continues to love Helena . \n",

      "10) David Bevington argues that the play represents the dark side of love . He writes that the fairies make light of love by mistaking the lovers and by applying a love potion to Titania 's eyes , forcing her to fall in love with an ass . In the forest , both couples are beset by problems . Hermia and Lysander are both met by Puck , who provides some comic relief in the play by confounding the four lovers in the forest . However , the play also alludes to serious themes . At the end of the play , Hippolyta and Theseus , happily married , watch the play about the unfortunate lovers , Pyramus and Thisbe , and are able to enjoy and laugh at it . Helena and Demetrius are both oblivious to the dark side of their love , totally unaware of what may have come of the events in the forest . \n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Short Answer: \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[1mDocument url: \u001b[0mhttps://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Valuation_(finance)&amp;oldid=788340232\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) It is important to note that valuation requires judgment and assumptions : \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Valuation of financial assets is done using one or more of these types of models : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Additional adjustments to a valuation approach , whether it is market - , income - , or asset - based , may be necessary in some instances like : \n",
      "\n",
      "4)Valuation ( finance ) - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "5) In mining , valuation is the process of determining the value or worth of a mining property . Mining valuations are sometimes required for IPOs , fairness opinions , litigation , mergers and acquisitions , and shareholder - related matters . In valuation of a mining project or mining property , fair market value is the standard of value to be used . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) This method determines the value of a firm by observing the prices of similar companies ( called `` guideline companies '' ) that sold in the market . Those sales could be shares of stock or sales of entire firms . The observed prices serve as valuation benchmarks . From the prices , one calculates price multiples such as the price - to - earnings or price - to - book ratios -- one or more of which used to value the firm . For example , the average price - to - earnings multiple of the guideline companies is applied to the subject firm 's earnings to estimate its value . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The third-most common method of estimating the value of a company looks to the assets and liabilities of the business . At a minimum , a solvent company could shut down operations , sell off the assets , and pay the creditors . Any cash that would remain establishes a floor value for the company . This method is known as the net asset value or cost method . In general the discounted cash flows of a well - performing company exceed this floor value . Some companies , however , are worth more `` dead than alive '' , like weakly performing companies that own many tangible assets . This method can also be used to value heterogeneous portfolios of investments , as well as nonprofits , for which discounted cash flow analysis is not relevant . The valuation premise normally used is that of an orderly liquidation of the assets , although some valuation scenarios ( e.g. , purchase price allocation ) imply an `` in - use '' valuation such as depreciated replacement cost new . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) show many assets based on their historic costs rather than at their current market values . For instance , a firm 's balance sheet will usually show the value of land it owns at what the firm paid for it rather than at its current market value . But under GAAP requirements , a firm must show the fair values ( which usually approximates market value ) of some types of assets such as financial instruments that are held for sale rather than at their original cost . When a firm is required to show some of its assets at fair value , some call this process `` mark - to - market '' . But reporting asset values on financial statements at fair values gives managers ample opportunity to slant asset values upward to artificially increase profits and their stock prices . Managers may be motivated to alter earnings upward so they can earn bonuses . Despite the risk of manager bias , equity investors and creditors prefer to know the market values of a firm 's assets -- rather than their historical costs -- because current values give them better information to make decisions . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Common terms for the value of an asset or liability are market value , fair value , and intrinsic value . The meanings of these terms differ . For instance , when an analyst believes a stock 's intrinsic value is greater ( less ) than its market price , an analyst makes a `` buy '' ( `` sell '' ) recommendation . Moreover , an asset 's intrinsic value may be subject to personal opinion and vary among analysts . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Stock markets give indirectly an estimate of a corporation 's intangible asset value . It can be reckoned as the difference between its market capitalisation and its book value ( by including only hard assets in it ) . \n",

      "1) Greene is introduced in The Godfather as a renowned Jewish mobster and former executioner for Murder , Inc . He is credited with the development of gambling and entertainment in Las Vegas and bringing the interests of the most powerful organized crime organizations in America to Nevada . Greene is in business with Don Vito Corleone , who bankrolls the creation of Greene 's first hotel - casino . In return , Greene takes the Don 's son Fredo under his wing during the war between the Five Families in New York , due to the intervention of West Coast Don Francesco . Although Fredo is greatly influenced by both Greene and the city , family heir Michael Corleone disapproves of the effect it has on his brother , whom Greene reportedly chastised and slapped around in public . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Alex Rocco 's portrayal of Greene `` cemented Rocco 's place in Hollywood mob cinema '' . Greene 's character and death scene has been described as `` iconic '' . Greene 's death is based on the actual murder of mobster , Bugsy Siegel . \n",

The character 's name is a composite of real Las Vegas mobsters Moe Dalitz , or possibly Moe Sedway , and Gus Greenbaum . However , both Greene 's character and personality are actually based on Bugsy Siegel : his affiliation with the mob in Los Angeles , his involvement in the development of Las Vegas , and his flamboyant tendencies .

      "9) At a discreet meeting with Greene , Michael expresses his disapproval and makes an offer to buy out Greene 's entire interest in the casino as part of the Corleones ' relocation to Nevada . Offended , Greene angrily refuses , claiming that the Corleones have neither the favor nor the power required to drive him out of the business and are only moving to Las Vegas because the other families are chasing them out of New York . In the film , he also belittles Michael 's credentials as a Don , saying , `` I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders ! '' \n",

      "1)Neil Armstrong - Wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) On April 5 , 1967 , the same day the Apollo 1 investigation released its final report on the fire , Armstrong assembled with 17 other astronauts for a meeting with Slayton . The first thing Slayton said was , `` The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room . '' According to Cernan , one of the astronauts present , Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement . To Armstrong it came as no surprise -- the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini , the only people who could fly the lunar missions . Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9 , which at that stage was planned to be a medium Earth orbit test of the Lunar Module -- Command / Service Module combination . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) In July 1969 , Armstrong and Apollo 11 Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin performed the first manned Moon landing , and spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command / Service Module . When Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface , he famously said : `` That 's one small step for ( a ) man , one giant leap for mankind . '' Along with Collins and Aldrin , Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon . President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong with the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978 , and Armstrong and his former crewmates received a Congressional Gold Medal in 2009 . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) After helping to set up the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package , Armstrong went for a walk to what is now known as East Crater , 65 yards ( 59 m ) east of the LM , the greatest distance traveled from the LM on the mission . Armstrong 's final task was to remind Aldrin to leave a small package of memorial items to Soviet cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Vladimir Komarov , and Apollo 1 astronauts Grissom , White and Chaffee . The time spent on EVA during Apollo 11 was two and a half hours ; each of the subsequent five landings was allotted a progressively longer period for EVA activities -- the crew of Apollo 17 spent over 22 hours exploring the lunar surface . In a 2010 interview , Armstrong explained that NASA limited his Moon walk because they were unsure how the spacesuits would cope with the extremely high temperature on the Moon . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) After Armstrong served as backup commander for Apollo 8 , Slayton offered him the post of commander of Apollo 11 on December 23 , 1968 , as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon . In a meeting that was not made public until the publication of Armstrong 's biography in 2005 , Slayton told him that although the planned crew was Armstrong as Commander , Lunar Module ( LM ) Pilot Buzz Aldrin and Command Module ( CM ) Pilot Michael Collins , he was offering Armstrong the chance to replace Aldrin with Jim Lovell . After thinking it over for a day , Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin , as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command . Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the Lunar Module Pilot , unofficially the lowest ranked member , and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell , the commander of Gemini 12 , in the number 3 position of the crew . The crew of Apollo 11 was officially announced on January 9 , 1969 , as Armstrong , Collins and Aldrin , with Lovell , Anders and Fred Haise as the backup crew . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group , which was selected in 1962 . He made his first spaceflight as commander of Gemini 8 in March 1966 , becoming NASA 's first civilian astronaut to fly in space . During this mission with pilot David Scott , he performed the first docking of two spacecraft ; the mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster . During training for Armstrong 's second and last spaceflight as commander of Apollo 11 , he had to eject from the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle moments before a fiery crash . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In a 2010 Space Foundation survey , Armstrong was ranked as the # 1 most popular space hero , and in 2013 , Flying magazine ranked him at # 1 on its list of the `` 51 Heroes of Aviation '' . The press often asked Armstrong for his views on the future of spaceflight . In 2005 , Armstrong said that a manned mission to Mars will be easier than the lunar challenge of the 1960s . In 2010 , he made a rare public criticism of the decision to cancel the Ares I launch vehicle and the Constellation Moon landing program . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Aldrin called him `` a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew '' , and said he was disappointed that they would not be able to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing together in 2019 . Collins said : `` He was the best , and I will miss him terribly . '' NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said that : `` As long as there are history books , Neil Armstrong will be included in them , remembered for taking humankind 's first small step on a world beyond our own '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) After being released from an 18 - day quarantine to ensure that they had not picked up any infections or diseases from the Moon , the crew were feted across the United States and around the world as part of a 45 - day `` Giant Leap '' tour . Armstrong then took part in Bob Hope 's 1969 USO show , primarily to Vietnam . In May 1970 , Armstrong traveled to the Soviet Union to present a talk at the 13th annual conference of the International Committee on Space Research ; after arriving in Leningrad from Poland , he traveled to Moscow where he met Premier Alexei Kosygin . Armstrong was the first westerner to see the supersonic Tupolev Tu - 144 and was given a tour of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center , which he described as `` a bit Victorian in nature '' . At the end of the day , he was surprised to view delayed video of the launch of Soyuz 9 -- it had not occurred to Armstrong that the mission was taking place , even though Valentina Tereshkova had been his host and her husband , Andriyan Nikolayev , was on board . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The lunar crater Armstrong , 31 miles ( 50 km ) from the Apollo 11 landing site , and asteroid 6469 Armstrong are named in his honor . There are more than a dozen elementary , middle and high schools named in his honor in the United States , and many places around the world have streets , buildings , schools , and other places named for Armstrong and / or Apollo . The Armstrong Air and Space Museum , in Armstrong 's hometown of Wapakoneta , and the airport in New Knoxville , Ohio , where he took his first flying lessons when he was fifteen , are named after him . Purdue University announced in October 2004 that its new engineering building would be named Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering in his honor ; the building was dedicated on October 27 , 2007 , during a ceremony at which Armstrong was joined by fourteen other Purdue Astronauts . The NASA Dryden Flight Research Center was renamed the NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center in 2014 . \n",

      "1)British Empire - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) By the start of the 20th century , Germany and the United States had begun to challenge Britain 's economic lead . Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War , during which Britain relied heavily upon its empire . The conflict placed enormous strain on the military , financial and manpower resources of Britain . Although the British Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after World War I , Britain was no longer the world 's pre-eminent industrial or military power . In the Second World War , Britain 's colonies in Southeast Asia were occupied by Japan . Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies , the damage to British prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire . India , Britain 's most valuable and populous possession , achieved independence as part of a larger decolonisation movement in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the empire . The transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire . Fourteen overseas territories remain under British sovereignty . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The independence of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after the American War of Independence caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies . British attention soon turned towards Asia , Africa , and the Pacific . After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars ( 1792 -- 1815 ) , Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century . Unchallenged at sea , British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica ( `` British Peace '' ) , a period of relative peace in Europe and the world ( 1815 -- 1914 ) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman . In the early 19th century , the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain ; so that by the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 , the country was described as the `` workshop of the world '' . The British Empire expanded to include most of India , large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world . Alongside the formal control that Britain exerted over its own colonies , its dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions , such as Asia and Latin America . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) In 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , ascended ( as James I ) to the English throne and in 1604 negotiated the Treaty of London , ending hostilities with Spain . Now at peace with its main rival , English attention shifted from preying on other nations ' colonial infrastructures to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies . The British Empire began to take shape during the early 17th century , with the English settlement of North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean , and the establishment of joint - stock companies , most notably the East India Company , to administer colonies and overseas trade . This period , until the loss of the Thirteen Colonies after the American War of Independence towards the end of the 18th century , has subsequently been referred to by some historians as the `` First British Empire '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Political boundaries drawn by the British did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions , contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas . The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples . Millions left the British Isles , with the founding settler populations of the United States , Canada , Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland . Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities , and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe . Settlers in Ireland from Great Britain have left their mark in the form of divided nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland . Millions of people moved to and from British colonies , with large numbers of Indians emigrating to other parts of the empire , such as Malaysia and Fiji , and Chinese people to Malaysia , Singapore and the Caribbean . The demographics of Britain itself was changed after the Second World War owing to immigration to Britain from its former colonies . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The British and French struggles in India became but one theatre of the global Seven Years ' War ( 1756 -- 1763 ) involving France , Britain and the other major European powers . The signing of the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) had important consequences for the future of the British Empire . In North America , France 's future as a colonial power effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to Rupert 's Land , and the ceding of New France to Britain ( leaving a sizeable French - speaking population under British control ) and Louisiana to Spain . Spain ceded Florida to Britain . Along with its victory over France in India , the Seven Years ' War therefore left Britain as the world 's most powerful maritime power . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council still serves as the highest court of appeal for several former colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific . British missionaries who travelled around the globe often in advance of soldiers and civil servants spread Protestantism ( including Anglicanism ) to all continents . The British Empire provided refuge for religiously persecuted continental Europeans for hundreds of years . British colonial architecture , such as in churches , railway stations and government buildings , can be seen in many cities that were once part of the British Empire . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War , the effects of the conflict were profound , both at home and abroad . Much of Europe , a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries , was in ruins , and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union , who now held the balance of global power . Britain was left essentially bankrupt , with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $ US 4.33 billion loan from the United States , the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006 . At the same time , anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations . The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union . In principle , both nations were opposed to European colonialism . In practice , however , American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism , and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in check . The `` wind of change '' ultimately meant that the British Empire 's days were numbered , and on the whole , Britain adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies once stable , non-Communist governments were available to transfer power to . This was in contrast to other European powers such as France and Portugal , which waged costly and ultimately unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact . Between 1945 and 1965 , the number of people under British rule outside the UK itself fell from 700 million to five million , three million of whom were in Hong Kong . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Under the terms of the concluding Treaty of Versailles signed in 1919 , the empire reached its greatest extent with the addition of 1,800,000 square miles ( 4,700,000 km ) and 13 million new subjects . The colonies of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were distributed to the Allied powers as League of Nations mandates . Britain gained control of Palestine , Transjordan , Iraq , parts of Cameroon and Togoland , and Tanganyika . The Dominions themselves also acquired mandates of their own : the Union of South Africa gained South West Africa ( modern - day Namibia ) , Australia gained New Guinea , and New Zealand Western Samoa . Nauru was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific Dominions . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) No further attempts to establish English colonies in the Americas were made until well into the reign of Queen Elizabeth I , during the last decades of the 16th century . In the meantime , the 1533 Statute in Restraint of Appeals had declared `` that this realm of England is an Empire '' . The subsequent Protestant Reformation turned England and Catholic Spain into implacable enemies . In 1562 , the English Crown encouraged the privateers John Hawkins and Francis Drake to engage in slave - raiding attacks against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of West Africa with the aim of breaking into the Atlantic slave trade . This effort was rebuffed and later , as the Anglo - Spanish Wars intensified , Elizabeth I gave her blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic , laden with treasure from the New World . At the same time , influential writers such as Richard Hakluyt and John Dee ( who was the first to use the term `` British Empire '' ) were beginning to press for the establishment of England 's own empire . By this time , Spain had become the dominant power in the Americas and was exploring the Pacific Ocean , Portugal had established trading posts and forts from the coasts of Africa and Brazil to China , and France had begun to settle the Saint Lawrence River area , later to become New France . \n",

      "9) Later in the year , Ninjago ended its second season still having positive feedback . A new show titled Legends of Chima would air in January 2013 . The show was faster and more productive than Ninjago and it received mixed reviews . In the same year , the `` Piece of Resistance '' film would be renamed `` The Lego Movie '' by Warner Bros. and it was released in February 2014 . The Lego Movie received wide acclaim from Lego fans and critics for its characters , plot , special effects and humor . Many actors from the Lego universe came to reprise their roles in the film . Due to the success of the film , a Ninjago film was announced to be released in 2017 , and a `` Lego Movie '' sequel was announced to be released in 2018 . In 2014 , Mixels also debuted . In late 2015 , Lego Nexo Knights was introduced , replacing Legends of Chima . On February 10 , 2017 , a spin - off film of The Lego Movie known as The Lego Batman Movie was released in theaters , only this time , the film 's story centers around The Lego Movie character and DC Comics superhero , Batman , and his `` adopted orphan son '' and apprentice sidekick , Robin . \n",

      "10) Brickfilms , videos using Lego , have existed since the 1970s . Starting in 2003 , Lego officially made their first film partnership to make films based on their toy property . They chose Bionicle as the property and they made a deal with Miramax to make a trilogy of Bionicle films . Over the years , after the trilogy ended , a new trilogy based on Bionicle was planned with Universal Pictures after the Miramax film contract ended and the first film in the new trilogy would be titled Bionicle : The Legend Reborn . But plans broke between Lego and Universal so they cancelled the fifth film in the series . But they continued on with a film titled Lego : The Adventures of Clutch Powers . The film received positive reviews from fans and critics and after the DVD release , a sequel was set to star Clutch as the hero again . A mini-sequel and a short film based on Clutch Powers were released and plans for a sequel are unknown . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> The atoms of metallic substances are typically arranged in one of three common crystal structures , namely body - centered cubic ( bcc ) , face - centered cubic ( fcc ) , and hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) . In bcc , each atom is positioned at the center of a cube of eight others . In fcc and hcp , each atom is surrounded by twelve others , but the stacking of the layers differs . Some metals adopt different structures depending on the temperature . </P>\n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) A metal ( from Greek μέταλλον métallon , `` mine , quarry , metal '' ) is a material ( an element , compound , or alloy ) that is typically hard when in solid state , opaque , shiny , and has good electrical and thermal conductivity . Metals are generally malleable -- that is , they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking -- as well as fusible ( able to be fused or melted ) and ductile ( able to be drawn out into a thin wire ) . About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals ; the others are nonmetals or metalloids . Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The electrical and thermal conductivities of metals originate from the fact that their outer electrons are delocalized . This situation can be visualized by seeing the atomic structure of a metal as a collection of atoms embedded in a sea of highly mobile electrons . The electrical conductivity , as well as the electrons ' contribution to the heat capacity and heat conductivity of metals can be calculated from the free electron model , which does not take into account the detailed structure of the ion lattice . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) In chemistry , the term base metal is used informally to refer to a metal that is easily oxidized or corroded , and reacts easily with dilute hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) to form metal chloride and hydrogen . Examples include iron , nickel , lead and zinc . Copper is considered a base metal as it is oxidized relatively easily , although it does not react with HCl . Base metal is commonly used in opposition to noble metal . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Atoms of metals readily lose their outer shell electrons , resulting in a free flowing cloud of electrons within their otherwise solid arrangement . This provides the ability of metallic substances to easily transmit heat and electricity . While this flow of electrons occurs , the solid characteristic of the metal is produced by electrostatic interactions between each atom and the electron cloud . This type of bond is called a metallic bond . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Noble metals are metals that are resistant to corrosion or oxidation , unlike most base metals . They tend to be precious metals , often due to perceived rarity . Examples include gold , platinum , silver , rhodium , iridium and palladium . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The transition metals ( such as iron , copper , zinc , and nickel ) are slower to oxidize because they form a passivating layer of oxide that protects the interior . Others , like palladium , platinum and gold , do not react with the atmosphere at all . Some metals form a barrier layer of oxide on their surface which can not be penetrated by further oxygen molecules and thus retain their shiny appearance and good conductivity for many decades ( like aluminium , magnesium , some steels , and titanium ) . The oxides of metals are generally basic , as opposed to those of nonmetals , which are acidic . Exceptions are largely oxides with very high oxidation states such as CrO , Mn O , and OsO , which have strictly acidic reactions . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The elements which are considered as metals under ordinary conditions are shown in yellow on the periodic table below . The remaining elements are shown either as nonmetals or as metalloids of intermediate character . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In alchemy , a base metal was a common and inexpensive metal , as opposed to precious metals , mainly gold and silver . A longtime goal of the alchemists was the transmutation of base metals into precious metals . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Metals in general have high electrical conductivity , high thermal conductivity , and high density . Typically they are malleable and ductile , deforming under stress without cleaving . In terms of optical properties , metals are shiny and lustrous . Sheets of metal beyond a few micrometres in thickness appear opaque , but gold leaf transmits green light . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Although most metals have higher densities than most nonmetals , there is wide variation in their densities , lithium being the least dense solid element and osmium the densest . The alkali and alkaline earth metals in groups IA and II A are referred to as the light metals because they have low density , low hardness , and low melting points . The high density of most metals is due to the tightly packed crystal lattice of the metallic structure . The strength of metallic bonds for different metals reaches a maximum around the center of the transition metal series , as those elements have large amounts of delocalized electrons in tight binding type metallic bonds . However , other factors ( such as atomic radius , nuclear charge , number of bonds orbitals , overlap of orbital energies and crystal form ) are involved as well . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> Active transport is the movement of molecules across a membrane from a region of their lower concentration to a region of their higher concentration -- in the direction against the concentration gradient .

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Unlike passive transport , which uses the kinetic energy and natural entropy of molecules moving down a gradient , active transport uses cellular energy to move them against a gradient , polar repulsion , or other resistance . Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs , such as ions , glucose and amino acids . If the process uses chemical energy , such as from adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , it is termed primary active transport . Secondary active transport involves the use of an electrochemical gradient . Examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the uptake of mineral ions into root hair cells of plants . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Active transport is the movement of molecules across a membrane from a region of their lower concentration to a region of their higher concentration -- in the direction against the concentration gradient . Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement . There are two types of active transport -- primary active transport that uses ATP , and secondary active transport that uses an electrochemical gradient . An example of active transport in human physiology is the uptake of glucose in the intestines . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Primary active transport , also called direct active transport , directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane . Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions , such as Na , K , Mg , and Ca . These charged particles require ion pumps or ion channels to cross membranes and distribute through the body . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Specialized transmembrane proteins recognize the substance and allow it to move across the membrane when it otherwise would not , either because the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane is impermeable to the substance moved or because the substance is moved against the direction of its concentration gradient . There are two forms of active transport , primary active transport and secondary active transport . In primary active transport , the proteins involved are pumps that normally use the chemical energy in the form of ATP . Secondary active transport , however , makes use of potential energy , which is usually derived through exploitation of an electrochemical gradient . The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient . This involves pore - forming proteins that form channels across the cell membrane . The difference between passive transport and active transport is that the active transport requires energy , and moves substances against their respective concentration gradient , whereas passive transport requires no energy and moves substances in the direction of their respective concentration gradient . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) In secondary active transport , also known as coupled transport or cotransport , energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane ; however , in contrast to primary active transport , there is no direct coupling of ATP ; instead it relies upon the electrochemical potential difference created by pumping ions in / out of the cell . Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient , but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases entropy and can serve as a source of energy for metabolism ( e.g. in ATP synthase ) . The energy derived from the pumping of protons across a cell membrane is frequently used as the energy source in secondary active transport . In humans , sodium ( Na ) is a commonly co-transported ion across the plasma membrane , whose electrochemical gradient is then used to power the active transport of a second ion or molecule against its gradient . In bacteria and small yeast cells , a commonly cotransported ion is hydrogen . Hydrogen pumps are also used to create an electrochemical gradient to carry out processes within cells such as in the electron transport chain , an important function of cellular respiration that happens in the mitochondrion of the cell . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Most of the enzymes that perform this type of transport are transmembrane ATPases . A primary ATPase universal to all animal life is the sodium - potassium pump , which helps to maintain the cell potential . The sodium - potassium pump maintains the membrane potential by moving three Na+ ions out of the cell for every two K+ ions moved into the cell . Other sources of energy for Primary active transport are redox energy and photon energy ( light ) . An example of primary active transport using Redox energy is the mitochondrial electron transport chain that uses the reduction energy of NADH to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient . An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in photosynthesis that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane and also to create reduction power in the form of NADPH . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In an antiporter , one substrate is transported in one direction across the membrane while another is cotransported in the opposite direction . In a symporter , two substrates are transported in the same direction across the membrane . Antiport and symport processes are associated with secondary active transport , meaning that one of the two substances is transported against its concentration gradient , utilizing the energy derived from the transport of another ion ( mostly Na , K or H ions ) down its concentration gradient . \n",
      "\n",
      "8)Active transport - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Endocytosis and exocytosis are both forms of bulk transport that move materials into and out of cells , respectively , via vesicles . In the case of endocytosis , the cellular membrane folds around the desired materials outside the cell . The ingested particle becomes trapped within a pouch , known as a vesicle , inside the cytoplasm . Often enzymes from lysosomes are then used to digest the molecules absorbed by this process . Substances that enter the cell via signal mediated endocytosis include proteins , hormones and growth factors . Viruses enter cells through a form of endocytosis that involves their outer membrane fusing with the membrane of the cell . This forces the viral DNA into the host cell . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Plants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources , but these salts exist in very dilute solution . Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the concentration gradient . For example , the molecules chlorine ( Cl ^ - ) and nitrate NO3 - exist in the cytosol of plant cells , and need to be transported into the vacuole . While the vacuole has channels for these ions , transportation of them is against the concentration gradient , and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps , or proton pumps \n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Minuit is generally credited with orchestrating the purchase of Manhattan Island for the Dutch from the Lenape Native Americans . Manhattan later became the site of the Dutch city of New Amsterdam , and the borough of Manhattan of modern - day New York City . A common account states that Minuit purchased Manhattan for $24 worth of trinkets . A letter written by Dutch merchant Peter Schaghen to directors of the Dutch East India Company stated that Manhattan was purchased `` for the value of 60 guilders '' in goods , an amount worth approximately $1,050 in 2015 dollars . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Minuit is credited with purchasing the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans in exchange for traded goods valued at 60 guilders . According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley , Minuit conducted the transaction with Seyseys , chief of the Canarsees , who were only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for an island that was mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks . \n",
      "\n",
      "3)Peter Minuit - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Minuit married Gertrude Raedts on August 20 , 1613 . Gertrude was from a wealthy family and she probably helped Peter Minuit establish himself as a broker . A will drawn up in 1615 in the Dutch city of Utrecht , mentions `` Peter Minnewit '' as a diamond cutter . Whether he traded in other items is unknown . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) A contemporary purchase of rights in nearby Staten Island , to which Minuit also was party , involved duffel cloth , iron kettles , axe heads , hoes , wampum , drilling awls , `` Jew 's harps '' , and `` diverse other wares '' . `` If similar trade goods were involved in the Manhattan arrangement '' , Burrows and Wallace surmise , `` then the Dutch were engaged in high - end technology transfer , handing over equipment of enormous usefulness in tasks ranging from clearing land to drilling wampum . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "6) After having lived in Cleves , Germany for several years , Minuit made arrangements with Samuel Blommaert and the Swedish government in 1636 or 1637 to create the first Swedish colony in the New World . Located on the lower Delaware River within territory earlier claimed by the Dutch , it was called New Sweden . Minuit and his company arrived on the Fogel Grip and Kalmar Nyckel at Swedes ' Landing ( now Wilmington , Delaware ) , in the spring of 1638 . They constructed Fort Christina later that year , then returned to Stockholm for a second load of colonists , and made a side trip to the Caribbean on the return to pick up a shipment of tobacco for resale in Europe to make the voyage profitable . During this voyage , Minuit drowned when the ship he was visiting ( at the invitation of it 's dutch captain , a friend of Minuit ) , The Flying Deer , was lost with all hands during a hurricane at St. Christopher ( today 's St. Kitts ) in the Caribbean . The losses suffered , such as goods , colonists , and Minuit , caused irreversible damage to Sweden 's colonization attempts . Two years later , Swedish Lt. Måns Nilsson Kling , whose rank was raised to captain , replaced him as governor . Nine expeditions to the colony were carried out before the Dutch captured it in 1655 . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Peter Minuit , Pieter Minuit , Pierre Minuit , or Peter Minnewit ( between 1580 and 1585 -- August 5 , 1638 ) was a Walloon from Wesel , in present - day North Rhine - Westphalia , Germany , then part of the Duchy of Cleves . His surname means `` midnight '' in French . He was Director of the Dutch North American colony of New Netherland from 1626 until 1631 , and founded the Swedish colony of New Sweden on the Delaware Peninsula in 1638 . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Minuit and his family joined the Dutch West India Company , probably in the mid-1620s , and was sent to New Netherland in 1625 to search for tradable goods other than the animal pelts that then were the major product coming from New Netherland . He returned in the same year , and in 1626 was appointed the new director of New Netherland , taking over from Willem Verhulst . He sailed to North America and arrived in the colony on May 4 , 1626 . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) By 1624 , the city was in an economic decline and in 1625 , he had left Wesel and like others , went to Holland . At first , Gertrude went to stay with her relatives in Cleve . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The figure of 60 guilders comes from a letter by a representative of the Dutch States - General and member of the board of the Dutch West India Company , Pieter Janszoon Schagen , to the States - General in November 1626 . In 1846 , New York historian John Romeyn Brodhead converted the figure of Fl 60 ( or 60 guilders ) to US $ 23 . The popular account rounds this off to $24 . By 2006 sixty guilders in 1626 was worth approximately $1,000 in current dollars , according to the Institute for Social History of Amsterdam . \n",

      "1)Ink Master - Wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Ink Master is an American reality competition television series airing on Spike which premiered on January 17 , 2012 . The show features tattoo artists who compete in various challenges assessing their tattoo and other related artistic skills . They are judged by renowned tattoo artists and enthusiasts , with one or more contestants being eliminated each episode . The last contestant standing each season receives a $100,000 prize and the title of Ink Master . The show is produced by Original Media which also produced the reality show Miami Ink . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Spin - off series Ink Master : Redemption premiered in September 2015 . The spin - off features canvases who are unhappy with the tattoo they received during the competition . After discussing their tattoo with Navarro , the canvases are given the chance to confront the artist who did the original piece . The artist is offered the chance for redemption by being able to consult with the canvas on a new tattoo ( or modification to improve their existing Ink Master piece ) . After reviewing the artist 's new drawing , the canvas is given a no - strings - attached choice to either proceed with the new tattoo or leave the shop . Episodes sometimes feature a twist , such as rival artists returning to draw a design for the same unhappy canvas , potentially stealing the original artist 's chance at redemption . Ink Master : Redemption was renewed for a second season to coincide with the premiere of season 7 of Ink Master . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Season two judging was taken to a new level with audience voting participation through the Ink Master website , and also via Facebook voting . The audience vote affected the final ruling by the judges . Sebastian Murphy was eliminated from consideration by the judges in the season finale because he was the contestant whose work in the elimination challenges received the fewest votes by the audience . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The sixth season of the show premiered on June 23 , 2015 . In May , the network renewed Ink Master for a seventh season which premiered on March 1 , 2016 . The eighth season of the tattoo reality competition Ink Master ( subtitled as Ink Master : Peck vs. Nuñez ) premiered on August 23 , 2016 on Spike . Season 8 had its first female winner . The show has been renewed for seasons 9 and 10 . Two spin - off shows , titled Ink Master : Redemption and Ink Master : Angels , have also been released . The series has also released a number of special standalone episodes generally themed around an upcoming event or holiday such as Halloween . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In June 2017 , Spike announced a new spin off series titled Ink Master : Angels . The premise follows four female contestants from the eighth season of Ink Master - season winner Ryan Ashley , Kelly Doty , Nikki Simpson and Gia Rose - as they travel around the United States to face other artists in tattoo challenges with a spot on season ten of Ink Master on the line . The show premiered on October 3 , 2017 . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Ink Master licensed a Dutch / Belgian edition called Ink Master : Meesters van de Lage Landen ( Masters of the Low Countries ) to Spike NL in 2017 . The format remains largely intact , filming takes place mainly around Amsterdam . The winner of the first season of this edition was the Belgian contestant `` Djoels '' \n",
      "\n",
      "8) For the finale of season one , the final challenge was a marathon tattooing of up to 18 hours . The season two finale did not share this format , and instead consisted of each of the three finalists meeting with his or her respective canvas for four six - hour sessions to create a final piece . This final piece did not require a specific tattoo genre or location for the artist to tattoo . Instead , the artists were able to choose those aspects for themselves , and the only restriction they faced was a time limit . The season three finale followed a similar format to the season two finale , but the artists were allowed five seven - hour sessions for a cumulative 35 - hour master canvas tattoo . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) After the Flash Challenge comes the Elimination Challenge , a further test of the skill of the week on a human canvas , typically incorporating a prominent style of tattooing . Once the contestants are paired up with their canvases , they are given the day to consult with their assignment . The next day , each contestant is given four to six hours to tattoo their design . Once completed , the contestants meet as a group with the judges and are critiqued one by one . The contestants then are dismissed , with four later being called back . The four typically represent a top two and bottom two for the week , though this breakdown can change . At the end of each episode , a winner is typically declared and one contestant is eliminated . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) There have been various standalone holiday and special event themed episodes made that do not follow the series seasons . They have typically followed an upcoming or recently passed holiday . These episodes feature previous Ink Master contestants competing for smaller cash prizes . \n",

In her desperation , she commits professional blunders , but ends up finding support in an unlikely source : her archenemy , the cameraman Pete Scanlon ( Edward Burns ) , with whom she once had casual sex .

      "2) Since 2010 , Ceuta and Melilla , both autonomous cities of Spain , have declared the Muslim holiday of Eid al - Adha or Feast of the Sacrifice , as an official public holiday . It was the first time a non-Christian religious festival has been officially celebrated in Spain since the Reconquista . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) If one of the `` national holidays '' happens to fall on a Sunday , twice in each month for two out of the seven holy months in the Spanish year , the regional governments -- the autonomous communities of Spain -- can choose an alternate holiday , or they can allow local authorities to choose . In practice , except for holidays falling on a Sunday , the regional governments can choose up to three holidays per year ; or they can choose fewer to allow for more options at the local level . \n",

      "1) In India , the term bungalow or villa refers to any single - family unit , as opposed to an apartment building , which is the norm for Indian middle - class city living . The normal custom for an Indian bungalow is one storey , but as time progressed many families built larger two - storey homes to accommodate members and pets . The area with bungalows built in 1920s -- 1930s in New Delhi is now known as Lutyens ' Bungalow Zone and is an architectural heritage area . In Bandra , a suburb of India 's commercial capital Mumbai , numerous colonial - era bungalows exist ; they are threatened by removal and replacement of ongoing development . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The term originated in India , deriving from the Hindi word `` बंगला '' ( baṅgala ) , meaning `` Bengali '' and used elliptically for a `` house in the Bengal style '' . This Asian architectural form and design originated in the countryside of Bengal region in South Asia . Such houses were traditionally small , of one story and detached , and had a wide veranda . The term was first found in English from 1696 , where it was used to describe `` bungales or hovells '' in India for English sailors of the East India Company . Later it became used for the spacious homes or official lodgings of officials of the British Raj , and was so known in Britain and later America , where it initially had high status and exotic connotations . The style began to be used in the late 19th century for large country or suburban residential buildings built in an Arts and Crafts or other Western vernacular style -- essentially as large cottages , a term also sometimes used . Later developers began to use the term for smaller buildings . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The first two bungalows in England were built in Westgate - on - Sea in 1869 or 1870 . A bungalow was a prefabricated single - story building used as a seaside holiday home . Manufacturers included Boulton & Paul Ltd , who made corrugated iron bungalows as advertised in their 1889 catalogue , which were erected by their men on the purchaser 's light brickwork foundation . An example is Castle Bungalow at Peppercombe , North Devon owned by the Landmark Trust ; it was built by Boulton and Paul in the 1920s . Construction of this type of bungalow peaked towards the end of the decade , to be replaced by brick construction . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) A bungalow is a type of building , originally developed in the Bengal region in South Asia , but now found throughout the world . The meaning of the word bungalow varies internationally . Common features of many bungalows include verandas and being low - rise . In Australia , the California bungalow associated with the United States was popular after the First World War . In North America and the United Kingdom , a bungalow today is a house , normally detached , that may contain a small loft . It is either single - story or has a second story built into a sloping roof , usually with dormer windows ( one - and - a-half stories ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) From 1891 the Federation Bungalow style swept across Australia , first in Camberwell , Victoria , and through Sydney 's northern suburbs after 1895 . The developer Richard Stanton built in Federation Bungalow style first in Haberfield , New South Wales , the first Garden Suburb ( 1901 ) , and then in Rosebery , New South Wales ( 1912 ) . Beecroft , Hornsby and Lindfield contain many examples of Federation Bungalows built between 1895 and 1920 . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In the post-colonial period , the term bungalow has been adapted and used to refer to any stand - alone residence , regardless of size , architectural style , or era in which it was built . Calling a house a bungalow often carries with it connotations of the price and status of the residence , and thus the wealth of its owner . Local real estate lingo commonly includes the word `` bungalow '' when referring to residences that are more normally described as `` detached '' , `` single - family homes '' , or even `` mansions '' in other countries . The pervasiveness of the word in the local jargon has resulted in bungalow being imported into the Malay language as the word banglo with the same meaning . \n",
      "\n",
      "7)Bungalow - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In the rural areas of Bangladesh ( the region which Bungalows are named after ) , this is often called `` Bangla Ghor '' ( Bengali Style House ) . The Bungalow - style homes are still very popular in the rural Bengal . The main construction material used in modern time is corrugated steel sheets . Previously they had been constructed from wood , bamboo and a kind of straw called `` Khar '' . Khar was used in the roof of the Bungalow and kept the house cooler during hot summer days . Another roofing material for Bungalow houses has been red clay tiles . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) From about 1910 until 1930 , the California Bungalow style was very popular in Australia and New Zealand . The style seems to have first been imported in Sydney and then spread throughout the Australian states and New Zealand . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) In Singapore and Malaysia , the term bungalow is sometimes used to refer to a house that was built during the colonial era . The structures were constructed `` from the early 19th century until the end of World War II . '' They were built by the British to house their `` military officers , High Court judges and other members of the colonial society 's great and good . '' \n",

      "3) The semi-final of the 1970 FIFA World Cup between Italy and West Germany is known as the `` Game of the Century '' ( Spanish : Partido del Siglo ; Italian : Partita del secolo ; German : Jahrhundertspiel ) . It was played on 17 June 1970 at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City . Italy won 4 -- 3 after five goals were scored in extra time , a record number of scored goals during any 2x15 minute extra time during a FIFA World Cup game . The record is still standing after the 2018 World Cup . Four goals in extra time were scored in the 1982 semifinal between West Germany and France . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Gerd Müller put Germany ahead in the 94th minute , but Tarcisio Burgnich tied it back up four minutes later and Luigi Riva put the Italians back in front . Gerd Müller scored again for West Germany to tie the score at 3 -- 3 . Yet , as television cameras were still replaying Müller 's goal , Italy 's Gianni Rivera scored the game - winning goal in the 111th minute . Being left unmarked near the penalty area , Rivera connected a fine cross made by Boninsegna , clinching the victory for Italy at 4 -- 3 . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) A monument commemorating this match was added to front of the Azteca . On a plaque the following sentence is engraved : El Estadio Azteca rinde homenaje a las selecciones de : Italia ( 4 ) y Alemania ( 3 ) protagonistas en el Mundial de 1970 , del `` Partido del Siglo '' 17 de junio de 1970 . English : The Azteca Stadium pays homage to the National Teams of Italy ( 4 ) and Germany ( 3 ) , who starred in the 1970 FIFA World Cup , the `` Game of the Century '' . 17 June 1970 . \n",

      "6) Italy , after having expended a great amount of energy in winning the hard - fought match , were roundly defeated by Brazil in the Final 4 -- 1 . Brazil thus became the first team to win three world football championships . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Italy led for the majority of the match , after Roberto Boninsegna scored in the 8th minute . Germany 's Franz Beckenbauer dislocated his shoulder after being fouled , but stayed on the field carrying his dislocated arm in a sling , as his side had already used their two permitted substitutions . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) West Germany would go on to defeat Uruguay in the third - place game , 1 -- 0 . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Defender Karl - Heinz Schnellinger equalized for West Germany during injury time at the end of the second half . German television commentator Ernst Huberty exclaimed `` Schnellinger , of all people ! '' ( in German : `` Schnellinger ! Ausgerechnet Schnellinger ! '' ) , since Schnellinger played in Italy 's professional football league , Serie A , at A.C. Milan ( for whom he had never scored ) and previously for A.S. Roma and A.C. Mantova . It was also his first and only goal in 47 matches for the national team . The second half ended with the scores deadlocked at 1 -- 1 , and at this point the match became a battle of endurance during the two periods of extra time . \n",

      "1) The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . \n",

The show , narrated by Future Ted , tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother . Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in `` Something New '' and was promoted to a main character in season 9 . The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti . </P>\n",

      "1) In the season 8 episode `` Band or DJ ? , '' Ted runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute . The end result of the encounter is that Cindy 's ( now ex - ) roommate 's band plays at Barney and Robin 's wedding . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) A petition was started , aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale . The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage . On April 5 , 2014 , Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD . No new material was shot for this scene . In the alternate ending , the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Some time after this , a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics . Darren gradually takes over the band . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) In the season 6 opener `` Big Days '' it is revealed Ted meets his future wife `` the day of '' the wedding at which he is the best man . In the episode `` False Positive '' Robin asks Ted to be her future best man , should she ever get married . In the episode `` Challenge Accepted '' , it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney 's wedding . In the last episode of season 7 , `` The Magician 's Code '' it is shown that Barney will marry Robin , and Ted will meet the mother `` the day of '' their wedding . On the premiere of season 8 , Ted 's wife appears after Barney and Robin 's wedding , outside at the `` Farhampton '' station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) During its first eight seasons , the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother . Well - known actresses often made guest appearances on the show . Many fans expected that another would play one of the most - wanted roles in Hollywood , but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown . Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples , Thomas said that `` We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience '' , similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had `` kept the show alive '' when it began . Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call . \n",
      "\n",

      "\u001b[1mQuestion 3: what type of fertilisation takes place in humans ?\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . </P>\n",
      "\u001b[1mDocument url: \u001b[0mhttps://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Human_fertilization&amp;oldid=831042507\n",

      "1) Recent studies have shown that the egg is not passive during this process . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The average time to birth has been estimated to be 268 days ( 38 weeks and two days ) from ovulation , with a standard deviation of 10 days or coefficient of variation of 3.7 % . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) In preparation for the fusion of their genetic material both the oocyte and the sperm undergo transformations as a reaction to the fusion of cell membranes . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The pronuclei migrate toward the center of the oocyte , rapidly replicating their DNA as they do so to prepare the zygote for its first mitotic division . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The fusion of cell membranes of the secondary oocyte and sperm takes place . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Various disorders can arise from defects in the fertilization process . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Where the spermatozoon is about to pierce , the yolk ( ooplasm ) is drawn out into a conical elevation , termed the cone of attraction or reception cone . Once the spermatozoon has entered , the peripheral portion of the yolk changes into a membrane , the perivitelline membrane , which prevents the passage of additional spermatozoa . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb , in vitro . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Fertilization age is sometimes used postnatally ( after birth ) as well to estimate various risk factors . For example , it is a better predictor than postnatal age for risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature babies treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) After binding to the corona radiata the sperm reaches the zona pellucida , which is an extra-cellular matrix of glycoproteins . A special complementary molecule on the surface of the sperm head binds to a ZP3 glycoprotein in the zona pellucida . This binding triggers the acrosome to burst , releasing enzymes that help the sperm get through the zona pellucida . \n",

It is probable , that this Settlement miscarry 'd for want of timely Supplies from England ; or thro ' the Treachery of the Natives , for we may reasonably suppose that the English were forced to cohabit with them , for Relief and Conversation ; and that in process of Time , they conform 'd themselves to the Manners of their Indian Relations . \n",

She portrayed Haeng - Bok , the bodyguard of the antagonist played by Sharlto Copley . A fan of the original film , Klementieff heard about the part through Roy Lee , a producer with the remake , and took boxing lessons after learning the role involved martial arts . After showcasing her boxing skills during her audition , Lee asked her to go home and come back wearing a more feminine outfit and make - up , like her character in the film . She contributed some of her own clothes to the character 's wardrobe , and trained three hours a day for two months for an on - screen fight with star Josh Brolin .

Her next acting role was the film Hacker 's Game ( 2015 ) , in which she plays a hacker she compared to Lisbeth Salander from the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo . Klementieff used her boxing skills again in the film , and due to the movie 's low budget , she had to do her own make - up and chose her own wardrobe . It was her idea to dye her hair purple for the role , to which the directors first objected but later acquiesced .

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> The survival of the Acadian settlements was based on successful cooperation with the Indigenous peoples of the region . In the early years of Acadian settlement , this included a small number of recorded marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women . Some records have survived showing marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women in formal Roman Catholic rites , for example , the marriage of Charles La Tour to a Mi'kmaw woman in 1626 . There were also reported instances of Acadian settlers marrying Indigenous spouses according to Mi'kmaq rites , and subsequently living in Mi'kmaq communities . Many settlers also brought French wives with them to Acadia , such as La Tour 's second wife , Françoise - Marie Jacquelin , who joined him in Acadia in 1640 . </P>\n",

      "1) Ocracoke was the last refuge of pirate Edward Teach , better known as Blackbeard . It is also where the infamous pirate was killed November 22 , 1718 in a fierce battle with troops from Virginia . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The winters are typically milder than in inland areas , averaging lows in the upper 30s and highs in the lower 50s , and is more frequently overcast than in the summer . However , the exposure of the Outer Banks makes them prone to higher winds , often causing wind chills to make the apparent temperature as cold as the inland areas . The summer months average lows from the mid-70s to highs in the upper 80s , depending on the time of the summer . The spring and fall are typically milder seasons . The fall and winter are usually warmer than areas inland , while the spring and the summer are often slightly cooler because of the moderating effects of being surrounded by water . \n",

European explorers to the Outer Banks as far back as the 1500s noted encountering the friendly Hatteras Island and Outer Banks natives , noting their hospitality to foreign explorers as well as their happiness and overall quality of life . European - borne diseases and migration to the mainland were likely the main causes for the decline of the native population . \n",

      "7) The Outer Banks are a popular destination for bottom fish like spot and mullet , these two types of fish are caught throughout the year . The peak for fishing bottom and top water feeders is early to the middle of May . If the angler is solely searching for top water fish , then late May and June would be the ideal time to fish , especially if they are searching for Mackerel . In the offseason , or winter months , the true fishermen are out searching for Trout , Sea Bass , Bluefish , Bluefin Tuna , Oysters , King Mackerel , Bay Scallops , and Striped Bass . In the spring , the popular catches are Grouper , Sea Trout , Sea Bass , Bluefish , Bluefin and Yellowfin tuna , Oysters , Snapper , Striped Bass , Red Drum , Croaker , Sea Mullet , King Mackerel , and Wahoo Late Spring and the beginning of summer is the favored time for top - water fish to move into the coastal waters near the Outer Banks , because of the warming waters and the increased visibility in the water The top water fish can see baitfish easily due to the decrease in murky water Plus they will start to migrate back North as the coastal waters to the south become too hot , the waters farther North will warm to their desired temperatures . Yet , in the prime tourist season of the summer , fishermen and many tourists have plenty of game options such as blue Marlin , White Marlin , Dolphin , Wahoo , Cobia , King Mackerel , Bluefish , Tuna , Flounder , snapper , Grouper , Spanish Mackerel , Crabs , Soft Crabs , Shrimp , Spot , Croaker , Sailfish , and Sea Mullet . By the fall , most tourists have started to leave , but fishermen are still out searching for Snapper , Channel Bass , Bluefish , King Mackerel , Grouper , Tuna , Oysters , Striped Bass , Sea Mullet , Spot , Clams , Speckled Trout , Flounder , and Shrimp . The prime season for fall fishing is late September to October 23 . Though the water is more turbulent and murky due to the strong northeast prevailing winds , there is still some big game fish left . Most of these fish are vacating back to the South for the warm waters . This makes it a prime time for smaller bottom fish who love to feed in murky , colder water . \n",

      "1) In reality , people and machines can not maintain 100 % efficiency and there will be stoppages for other reasons . Allowances should be made for these instances , and thus the line will be set up to run at a faster rate to account for this . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Downsides of takt time organization include : \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Net available time is the amount of time available for work to be done . This excludes break times and any expected stoppage time ( for example scheduled maintenance , team briefings , etc . ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) If customer demand were 400 units a day and one shift were being run , then the line would be required to output at a minimum rate of one part per minute in order to be able to keep up with customer demand . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Once a takt system is implemented there are a number of benefits : \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Example : If there are a total of 8 hours ( or 480 minutes ) in a shift ( gross time ) less 30 minutes lunch , 30 minutes for breaks ( 2 × 15 mins ) , 10 minutes for a team briefing and 10 minutes for basic maintenance checks , then the net Available Time to Work = 480 - 30 - 30 - 10 - 10 = 400 minutes . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Takt time is a borrowing of the Japanese word takutotaimu ( タクト タイム ) , which in turn was borrowed from the German word Taktzeit , meaning clock interval . The word was likely introduced to Japan by German engineers in the 1930s . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Takt time is calculated on virtually every task in a business environment . It is used in manufacturing ( casting of parts , drilling holes , or preparing a workplace for another task ) , control tasks ( testing of parts or adjusting machinery ) , or in administration ( answering standard inquiries or call center operation ) . It is , however , most common in production lines that move a product along a line of stations that each performs a set of predefined tasks . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Also , takt time may be adjusted according to requirements within the company . For example , if one department delivers parts to several manufacturing lines , it often makes sense to use similar takt times on all lines to smooth out flow from the preceding station . Customer demand can still be met by adjusting daily working time , reducing down times on machines and so on . \n",

A kindly stranger tells him that the storm is the infamous `` Midwinter Jicker '' and allows the protagonist to take shelter in his house , where a family of mice and a family of owls are also taking shelter . \n",

      "8) At the gates of Solla Sollew , the protagonist is greeted by a friendly doorman . The doorman explains to the protagonist about the only trouble the city has : a key - slapping slippard has moved into the lock of the door , which happens to be the only way into Solla Sollew , and bugs the doorman by continuously slapping the key out of his hand , preventing anyone from entering the city . As it 's considered bad luck to kill a slippard , the doorman can not do anything to evict this pest , but decides instead to leave Solla Sollew for the city of Boola Boo Ball , on the banks of the beautiful river Woo - Wall , and known to never have troubles ( `` No troubles at all ! !

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> In the early 1960s , the Nashville sound began to be challenged by the rival Bakersfield sound on the country side and by the British Invasion on the pop side ; compounding these problems were the sudden deaths , in separate airplane crashes , of Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves , two of the Nashville Sound 's biggest stars . Nashville 's pop song structure became more pronounced and it morphed into what was called Countrypolitan - a smoother sound typified through the use of lush string arrangements with a real orchestra and often , background vocals provided by a choir . Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s . Among the architects of this sound were producers Billy Sherrill ( who was instrumental in shaping Tammy Wynette 's early career ) and Glenn Sutton . Artists who typified the countrypolitan sound initially included Wynette , Glen Campbell ( who recorded in Hollywood and not Nashville ) , Lynn Anderson , Charlie Rich , and Charley Pride , the latter being a rare example of a top - selling African - American country performer . </P>\n",

      "1) In an essay published in Heartaches by the Number : Country Music 's 500 Greatest Singles , David Cantwell argues that Elvis Presley 's rock and roll recording of `` Do n't Be Cruel '' in July 1956 was the record that sparked the beginning of the era now called the Nashville sound . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Regarding the Nashville sound , the record producer Owen Bradley stated , `` Now we 've cut out the fiddle and steel guitar and added choruses to country music . But it ca n't stop there . It always has to keep developing to keep fresh . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Upon being asked what the Nashville sound was , Chet Atkins would put his hand into his pocket , shake his loose change , and say `` That 's what it is . It 's the sound of money '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) By the late 1970s and 1980s , many pop music singers picked up the countrypolitan style and created what is known as country pop , the fusion of country music and soft rock . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The Bakersfield sound , and later outlaw country , dominated country music among aficionados while countrypolitan reigned on the pop charts . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Nashville sound was pioneered by staff at Decca Records , RCA Records and Columbia Records in Nashville , Tennessee , including manager Steve Sholes , record producers Chet Atkins , Owen Bradley , and Bob Ferguson , and recording engineer Bill Porter . They invented the form by replacing elements of the popular honky tonk style ( fiddles , steel guitar , nasal lead vocals ) with `` smooth '' elements from 1950s pop music ( string sections , background vocals , crooning lead vocals ) , and using `` slick '' production , and pop music structures . The producers relied on a small group of studio musicians known as the Nashville A-Team , whose quick adaptability and creative input made them vital to the hit - making process . The Anita Kerr Quartet was the main vocal backing group in the early 1960s . In 1960 , Time magazine reported that Nashville had `` nosed out Hollywood as the nation 's second biggest ( after New York ) record - producing center . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music , replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with `` smooth strings and choruses '' , `` sophisticated background vocals '' and `` smooth tempos '' . It was an attempt `` to revive country sales , which had been devastated by the rise of rock ' n ' roll . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "8)Nashville sound - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The term `` Nashville Sound '' was first mentioned in an article about Jim Reeves in 1958 in the Music Reporter and again in 1960 in a Time magazine article about Reeves . Other observers have identified several recordings that helped establish the early Nashville sound . Country historian Rich Kienzle says that `` Gone '' , a Ferlin Husky hit recorded in November 1956 , `` may well have pointed the way to the Nashville sound . '' Writer Colin Escott proclaims Jim Reeves ' `` Four Walls '' , recorded February 1957 , to be the `` first ' Nashville sound ' record '' , and Chet Atkins , the RCA - based producer and guitarist most often credited with being the sound 's primary artistic brainchild , pointed to his production of Don Gibson 's `` Oh Lonesome Me '' late that same year . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) In the early 1960s , the Nashville sound began to be challenged by the rival Bakersfield sound on the country side and by the British Invasion on the pop side ; compounding these problems were the sudden deaths , in separate airplane crashes , of Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves , two of the Nashville Sound 's biggest stars . Nashville 's pop song structure became more pronounced and it morphed into what was called Countrypolitan - a smoother sound typified through the use of lush string arrangements with a real orchestra and often , background vocals provided by a choir . Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s .

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[1mDocument url: \u001b[0mhttps://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=The_New_Atlantis_(journal)&amp;oldid=803542973\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) The journal has published widely on bioethics , including issues such as stem cell research , assisted reproduction , cloning , assisted suicide , organ and tissue donation , the purported link between vaccines and autism , and informed consent . Articles on these issues often highlight the potential for dangerous or degrading developments , including concerns over human dignity , with many articles examining human enhancement , and life extension , and historical precedents for abuse in eugenics and population control . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) By contrast , the liberal bioethicist Jonathan D. Moreno has said that the journal offers `` a very dark vision '' about science and technology , but that it `` makes an important point about the need to worry about the ends as well as means in science '' and that its `` writers were young , smart , and had a good understanding of the political process and the making of public policy . '' Bioethicist Ruth Macklin criticized The New Atlantis as representative of a conservative movement in bioethics that is `` mean - spirited , mystical , and emotional '' and that `` claims insight into ultimate truth yet disavows reason . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Among the more notable contributors to the journal are physicians and bioethicists such as President 's Council on Bioethics chairman Leon Kass and neuroscientist William B. Hurlbut ; prominent scientists such as Raymond Tallis , Sara Seager , and Marcelo Gleiser ; political scientists , legal and ethical scholars , and policy analysts such as Yuval Levin , Robert P. George , Peter Augustine Lawler , Diana Schaub , Charles T. Rubin , Jeffrey Rosen , Larry Arnhart , and Jonathan B. Tucker ; think - tank scholars such as Nicholas Eberstadt , Roger Bate , Henry Sokolski , and Robert D. Atkinson ; space experts and entrepreneurs such as Mars Society founder Robert Zubrin , James C. Bennett , and Jeff Foust ; and philosophers , historians , authors , and journalists such as Roger Scruton , Gertrude Himmelfarb , Matthew B. Crawford , Harvey Mansfield , Wilfred M. McClay , Ross Douthat , Victor Davis Hanson , Alan Jacobs , Varadaraja V. Raman , Stephen D. Snobelen , Andrew Janiak , William R. Newman , and Ronald Bailey . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The journal has particularly gained a reputation among the transhumanist movement for its criticism of human enhancement . James Hughes , a techno - progressivist and at times director of organizations such as the World Transhumanist Association and the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies , notes that the journal `` has published influential attacks on artificial intelligence , nanotechnology , biotechnology , reproductive technology , and life extension . '' Natasha Vita - More has described it as a `` journal known as a ring of bioconservatives bent on opposing the cyberculture , '' while the Extropy Institute has called it `` a high - powered rallying point for the neo-Luddites . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The journal also features broader philosophical reflections on science and technology , and tends to be skeptical of what its authors consider to be speculative overreach common in popular discussions . Examples include articles that have defended the existence of free will in light of developments in neuroscience , questioned the wisdom of using brain scans in courtrooms , and described how growing knowledge of epigenetics has undermined common claims about genetic determinism . While the journal has sometimes aired libertarian views about human enhancement and transhumanism , its contributors generally tend to question whether technologies like artificial intelligence , `` friendly '' artificial intelligence , and genetic enhancement are possible or desirable . The journal also publishes the Futurisms blog , dedicated to criticizing transhumanism . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Richard John Neuhaus , late editor of the conservative journal First Things , wrote that The New Atlantis is `` as good a publication as there is for the intelligent exploration of questions in bioethics and projections -- promising , ominous , and fantastical -- about the human future , '' and a writer in The American Conservative described the journal as a source `` of fresh ideas on the Right . '' National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg described The New Atlantis as `` a new and interesting magazine '' that `` seems to be trying to carve out the space for the government to stop the more offensive aspects of biotechnology . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Writing for the National Review in a 2003 column , the conservative author Stanley Kurtz described The New Atlantis as influential on thinking about science and technology . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The New Atlantis tends to publish views in favor of technological innovation but wary of certain avenues of development . For example , the journal has generally advocated nuclear energy ; space exploration and development through public - private partnerships , including manned missions to Mars ; biofuels ; and genetically modified foods . But it has expressed ambivalent or critical views about developments in synthetic biology and military technologies like drones , chemical weapons , and cyberwarfare . Articles often explore policy questions on these and other issues , sometimes advocating particular policy outcomes , especially on health care , environmental management , and energy . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The New Atlantis , founded in 2003 , is a quarterly journal about the social , ethical , political , and policy dimensions of modern science and technology . The journal is published in Washington , D.C. by the social conservative advocacy group the Ethics and Public Policy Center in partnership with the Center for the Study of Technology and Society . It is edited by Ari Schulman , having previously been edited by co-founders Eric Cohen and Adam Keiper . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The journal has also published widely on the interpersonal effects of the Internet and digital technology . It has featured articles on subjects like Facebook , cell phones , multitasking , e-readers , GPS and navigation , and virtual reality . A 2006 article by Matthew B. Crawford advocating the intellectual and economic virtues of the manual trades was noted as a best - of - the - year essay by New York Times columnist David Brooks , and was subsequently expanded into the bestselling book Shop Class as Soulcraft . The journal also frequently publishes essays on philosophical and literary questions relating to science and technology . \n",

In Ireland , a different situation applies ; a package of only one Saturday 3 : 00pm kick off each week ( along with one game on the final Sunday ) is sold as an addition to the UK live rights packages , this package is currently held by Sky Sports . While there is no rule prohibiting the screening of the other 3 : 00pm games in Ireland , the Premier League does not make the rights to these games available to Irish broadcasters , due to the overlap in reception that is possible in Northern Ireland and mainland England and not 's total match completely absolute live in total all interviews season the paradox that total matches live other will only be seen on streaming sites of he Premier League TV . \n",

Andy considers suing the town with the hopes of getting money and winning Ann back , but Leslie convinces him to settle out of court in exchange for having the pit filled in . Leslie gives Andy a job as the shoe - shiner at the Pawnee City Hall as part of his settlement . April Ludgate , the parks department intern , begins to develop a crush on Andy , but he is for a long time unaware of her feelings toward him . As time goes on , Andy begins to develop feelings for April , though he is unsure about dating her due to their age difference and his own unresolved feelings for Ann . Simultaneously , Ann begins to show similar feelings for Andy after her relationship with Mark ends . At the end of the season , having broken up with Mark , Ann kisses Andy , who does not reciprocate . This later causes him problems with April , who continues to believe he is still in love with Ann . \n",

      "\u001b[1mQuestion 31: when do they pull the powerball numbers 2016 ?\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> Drawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10 : 59 p.m. Eastern Time . Since October 7 , 2015 , the game has used a 5 / 69 ( white balls ) + 1 / 26 ( Powerballs ) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen , resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play . Each play costs $2 , or $3 with the Power Play option . ( Originally , Powerball plays cost $1 ; when PowerPlay began , such games were $2 . ) The official cutoff for ticket sales is 10 : 00 p.m. Eastern Time ; some lotteries cut off sales earlier . The drawings are usually held at the Florida Lottery 's studio in Tallahassee . </P>\n",

      "1) All non-jackpot prizes are fixed amounts ( except in California ) ; they may be reduced and paid on a parimutuel basis , with each member paying differing amounts for the same prize tier , if the liability exceeds the funds in the prize pool for any game member . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) On November 2 , 1997 , the annuity was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments ; the cash option was added . The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments , increasing 5 % annually . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Since the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts ( except in California ) , if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables . Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently , it is possible lower - tier prizes will differ among the game members . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) On Jan 19 , 2014 , PowerPlay was modified ; it used 30 balls with the following distribution : \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Overall odds of winning were 1 in 31.85 . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) On March 7 , 2001 , an optional multiplier ( called Power Play ) was added , allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game . A wheel was introduced to select the Power Play multiplier for each drawing ( the next year , the 1x was removed from the Power Play wheel . ) \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Power Play , when it began in 2001 , was drawn with a special wheel . In 2006 and 2007 , MUSL replaced one of the 5 × spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10 × . During each month - long promotion , MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10 × multiplier . The promotion returned in 2008 ; the ball landed in the 10 × space twice . After being absent in 2009 , the 10 × multiplier returned in May 2010 ( after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG . ) The promotion was extended for the only time , as the 10 × multiplier was not drawn until June 12 . The second prize 5 × guarantee continued ; the 10 × applied to all non-jackpot prizes , as in previous promotions . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The double matrixes and probabilities in the game 's history : \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Two identical machines are used for each drawing , randomly selected from four sets . The model of machine used is the Halogen , manufactured by Smartplay International of Edgewater Park , New Jersey . There are eight ball sets ( four of each color ) ; one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing . The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber . When the machine selects a ball , the turntable slows to catch it , sends it up the shaft , and then down the rail to the display . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) MUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners . If a jackpot ticket is not claimed , the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool . The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used . \n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[1mDocument url: \u001b[0mhttps://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=All_that_is_gold_does_not_glitter&amp;oldid=810397593\n",

      "1) The second quatrain was added during the following revision : \n",
      "\n",
      "2) In Peter Jackson 's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings for film , the poem appears in The Return of the King , when Arwen recites the last four lines of the poem as her father Elrond prepares to reforge the shards of Narsil for Aragorn . In the 1981 BBC radio dramatisation , the entire poem is heard in its original context , the letter left at Bree by Gandalf . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The poem appears twice in The Fellowship of the Ring , the first volume of The Lord of the Rings . It appears first in Chapter Ten , `` Strider '' , in Gandalf 's letter to Frodo Baggins in Bree , although when Frodo reads it he does not realize that Strider ( Aragorn ) is the subject of the verse . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The verse is repeated by Bilbo at the Council of Elrond . He whispers to Frodo that he wrote it many years before , when Aragorn first revealed who he was . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) `` All That is Gold Does Not Glitter '' ( alternatively known as `` The Riddle of Strider '' or `` Song of Aragorn '' ) is a poem written by J.R.R. Tolkien for his fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings . It alludes to an integral part of the plot , and describes Aragorn , son of Arathorn . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The way appearance displays reality in our world is largely inverted in Middle - earth with respect to the subject matter of the poem . The first line is a variant and rearrangement of the proverb `` All that glitters is not gold '' , known primarily from Shakespeare 's The Merchant of Venice , resulting in a proposition bearing a completely different meaning : Aragorn is vastly more important than he looks . The second line emphasizes the importance of the Rangers , suspiciously viewed as wanderers or vagabonds by those the Rangers actually protect from evil . Lines three and four emphasize the endurance of Aragorn 's royal lineage , while five and six emphasizes its renewal . They can also be seen to represent a spark of hope during a time of despair and danger . Line seven refers to the sword Narsil . Line eight foreshadows the crownless Aragorn 's accession to the throne of both the kingless Gondor and the vanished Arnor . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The lines were changed in stages , with many experimental forms rejected . Christopher Tolkien also suggested that `` the Sword that was Broken ( Narsil ) actually emerged from the verse ' All that is gold does not glitter ' : on this view , in ( the last version cited above ) the words a king may yet be without crown , A blade that was broken be brandished were no more than a further exemplification of the general moral . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The early versions of the poem are recorded in The Treason of Isengard , part of The History of Middle - earth book series by Christopher Tolkien . The first draft of the poem , which at that stage of composition was the only content of Gandalf 's letter , reads : \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Older editions of The Lord of the Rings indexed the poem as `` The Riddle of Strider '' . From the 50th anniversary edition of 2005 on , the new , enlarged index by Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull list it as `` All that is gold does not glitter '' . \n",

Robert Carlyle also expressed that he 'd have to make a decision about his future on the show by the end of that month . In March 2017 , several sources had reported that four of the current main cast members in particular - Morrison , Carlyle , Lana Parrilla , and Colin O'Donoghue - were in negotiations to renew their contracts for a potential seventh season . In April 2017 , Horowitz and Kitsis confirmed that a group of characters will indeed have their stories wrapped up by the end of the season in acknowledging the potential cast changes , saying : `` We planned this finale from the beginning of the year , so whoever stays and whoever goes ... all those questions have already been dealt with . The audience does not have to fear ( anything feeling ) incomplete . '' On May 8 , Morrison confirmed that she had declined an offer to remain on the show and that the sixth season would be her last , signaling the end of Emma 's time on the show as the main protagonist . On May 11 , Rebecca Mader announced that she would also be leaving the show at the end of the season , citing creative decisions beyond her control . On May 12 , season six was announced to be the last for four additional main actors : Ginnifer Goodwin , Josh Dallas , Jared Gilmore , and Emilie de Ravin . Thus , characters seeing their storylines wrapped up in the season six finale include Emma Swan , Snow White , Prince Charming , Belle , and Zelena . The season finale revealed that Henry Mills will remain a series protagonist , with the setting shifting to a later time period in which he is portrayed as an adult by Andrew J. West . \n",

      "6) The sixth season of the American ABC fantasy - drama Once Upon a Time was ordered on March 3 , 2016 . It debuted on September 25 , 2016 , and concluded on May 14 , 2017 . In January 2017 , it was stated that the sixth season would end the main storyline , and for a seventh season , the series would be softly rebooted with a new storyline . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis announced that they were ending the half - season arc structure that was seen in seasons three through five , with Horowitz saying , `` We 're also planning a 22 - episode story as opposed to breaking it up into two halves this year . It has been really exciting and fun . '' Kitsis added : `` We are changing around what we 're doing this year and going back to that season 1 mentality of small town stories and smaller arcs . '' This season will focus on Storybrooke as the main setting , but will also show new realms and there will be the exploration of the Savior 's mythology . Kitsis and Horowitz hired two directors from their Freeform series Dead of Summer , Norman Buckley , Mairzee Almas , and Michael Schultz helm episodes of the season . Jennifer Lynch directed the eighth episode of the season , `` I 'll Be Your Mirror '' . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) On May 8 , 2017 , Jennifer Morrison announced that she had declined an offer to remain on the show through season 7 and would not be returning to Once Upon a Time as a series regular in the event the series was renewed by ABC . However , Morrison noted that she had signed a contract to appear in one episode in season 7 . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In January 2017 , TV Line reported that the series would feature a musical episode later in the season . Creators Kitsis and Horowitz had spoken about the desire to do a musical installment previously , but did n't `` even know where to begin . '' Kitsis and Horowitz confirmed the report in February . They have also since confirmed that the episode will feature 7 original songs , including solos by Jennifer Morrison and Rebecca Mader , as well as a `` sing - off '' musical number featuring the Evil Queen and the Charmings . Composers Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner will be writing the original numbers featured , with arrangements provided by the show 's long - time composer Mark Isham . Kitsis and Hororwitz spoke about the nature of the episode saying , `` It actually is a huge part of the mythology of the show and there are some big things that happen in the episode , frankly , it 's been one of the challenges of doing the musical because we never wanted to do something where it was just like a to - the - side , one - off thing , and then get back to the main story . We want to see it part of the main story , which meant we had to really plan out this season with some great detail . '' \n",

      "10) Emilie de Ravin told fans that she will be returning for the sixth season . It was also announced later that Sam Witwer and Hank Harris have signed a contract to play two new recurring characters on the sixth season of the show . On March 29 , 2016 , Lana Parrilla confirmed she would be returning for the sixth season . Robert Carlyle was confirmed to be returning for the sixth season as Rumplestiltskin along with Rebecca Mader as Zelena and Jared Gilmore as Henry Mills . \n",

      "\u001b[1mQuestion 40: when does a tv show go into syndication ?\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[1mDocument url: \u001b[0mhttps://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Broadcast_syndication&amp;oldid=837862653\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Off - network syndication in its various forms , including Internet , international and traditional direct - to - station sales , constitute roughly half of an individual television program 's overall revenue stream , with the other half taken up by advertising . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) As with commercial stations , not all the airtime nor all the perceived audience are met by the productions offered U.S. public - broadcasting stations by PBS ; additionally , there are some independent public television stations in the U.S. which take no programming from that ( somewhat ) decentralized network . As a result , there are several syndicators of programming for the non-profit stations , several of which are descendants of the regional station groups which combined some , not all , of their functions into the creation of PBS in 1969 . American Public Television ( APT ) is the largest of these , nearly matched by the National Educational Telecommunications Association ( NETA ) ; similarly , the now defunct Continental Program Marketing was another of the syndicator - descendants ( of the Northeastern , Southeastern , and Rocky Mountain educational networks , respectively ) of the pre-PBS era . Among the other notable organizations in the U.S. are Westlink Satellite Operations ( based at Albuquerque 's KNME ) , BBC Worldwide Americas ( which often works with other distributors and individual stations , since it has no satellite access of its own in the U.S. ) , Deutsche Welle , Executive Program Services , the Program Resource Group and PBS 's Long Island , New York member station WLIW , which is ( with the arguable exception of KNME ) the most prolific contributor of any individual station of syndicated programming , most obviously the BBC World News , Doctor Who and Monty Python 's Flying Circus in the U.S. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) After the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , syndicated talk radio saw a notably rapid rise in popularity , as networks rushed new national shows into syndication to meet the demand for discussion of national issues . Many of these , such as Laura Ingraham , Bill O'Reilly , Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck , were mostly supportive of the actions of the Republican - led government ; a few others , such as Alex Jones , were openly critical of the government 's actions and motives . After the Democrats took control in the late 2000s , the gap between the two styles narrowed due to the mutual opposition of both camps to the government 's actions , which allowed Jones greater clearance on stations . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Among other syndicated series of the 1950s were MCA 's The Abbott and Costello Show ( vaudeville - style comedy ) and Guild Films ' Liberace ( musical variety ) and Life With Elizabeth , a domestic situation comedy that introduced Betty White to a national audience . In addition to the Adventures of Superman , many other series were based on comic strips and aimed at the juvenile audience , including Flash Gordon , Dick Tracy , Sheena , Queen of the Jungle , and Joe Palooka . Original juvenile adventure series included Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion , Cowboy G - Men , and Ramar of the Jungle . Series based on literary properties included Sherlock Holmes , Long John Silver ( based on Treasure Island ) , and The Three Musketeers . Several of these were co-productions between U.S. and European ( usually British ) companies . Crusader Rabbit pioneered in the area of first - run animated series ; followed by Bucky and Pepito , Colonel Bleep , Spunky and Tadpole , Q.T. Hush , and others . ( All of these were five - minute shorts designed to be placed within locally hosted kiddie shows . ) Syndicated sports programming included Championship Bowling and All - Star Golf , both produced by Chicago - based Walter Schwimmer , Inc . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Another area where network dominance was challenged by syndicated programming in the 1980s was with late - night talk shows ; The Arsenio Hall Show was the only very successful one ( it would be canceled after five years in 1994 due to ratings declines spurred by many CBS affiliates pushing the show to later timeslots following the debut of the Late Show with David Letterman , and was later revived in 2013 ) , but similar programs were attempted such as Alan Thicke 's earlier short - lived Thicke of the Night , Lauren Hutton 's innovatively shot Lauren Hutton and ... , and talk shows hosted by Dennis Miller , Whoopi Goldberg , David Brenner and Keenen Ivory Wayans ; Magic Johnson 's The Magic Hour was seen as a massive flop , similar to Thicke of the Night . The popularity of syndicated talk shows fell dramatically in the mid-1990s as network and cable offerings expanded in the wake of Johnny Carson 's retirement . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Since the early 2000s , some programs being proposed for national distribution in first - run syndication have been test marketed on a selected number of or all stations owned by certain major station group , allowing the distributor to determine whether a national roll - out is feasible based on the ratings accrued in the selected markets where the program is being aired . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Meanwhile , the popularity of some of the audience - participation talk shows continues to encourage new participants , some of whom , such as Morton Downey , Jr. and Rosie O'Donnell , have brief periods of impressive ratings and influence ; others , such as Oprah Winfrey and Maury Povich , have a sustained run . A notable scheduling decision was made by KRON - TV in San Francisco : a 2000 dispute with NBC led to that station 's disaffiliation from that network after 52 years , and since all the other larger networks were already represented in San Francisco , KRON decided to become one of the largest commercial independent stations by market size on the VHF band in the U.S. , and soon tried running Dr. Phil , a popular new stripped series hosted by Winfrey - associate Phil McGraw , in primetime , with impressive ratings results . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) First - run syndicated shows in the United States include talk shows ( e.g. , The Dr. Oz Show , Dr. Phil and The Ellen DeGeneres Show ) ; tabloid / newsmagazine shows ( e.g. , TMZ Live ) ; crime / law enforcement shows ( e.g. , Crime Watch Daily ) ; game shows ( e.g. , Family Feud , Jeopardy ! and Wheel of Fortune ) ; reality court shows ( e.g. , Judge Judy ) ; and sitcoms ( e.g. , The First Family ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Because of the structural differences discussed above , there are presently very few areas where a true U.S. - style syndication model operates , whereby programs are sold on a per - area basis ( within a single country ) to local or regional stations with differing ( or no ) network affiliations . Canada was historically one of the few exceptions . Until the mid-1990s , television stations in Canada , like those in the U.S. , were typically run as separate local operations , with a small number of moderately sized ownership groups such as Baton , CanWest , WIC , and CHUM . Those stations that were affiliated with a national network , i.e. CBC or CTV , did not always receive a full schedule of programming from that network . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) More new shows were added for the 2008 -- 09 fall season , including a daytime run of Deal or No Deal ( which featured certain elements that differed from the show 's franchised format , most notably with prospective players instead of models holding briefcases that held the monetary amounts ) and an adaptation of the popular board game Trivial Pursuit . While Deal caught on and was renewed for the 2009 -- 2010 season , Trivial Pursuit : America Plays suffered low ratings throughout its run and was canceled . \n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[1mDocument url: \u001b[0mhttps://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=San_Andreas_Fault&amp;oldid=808545169\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) The information available suggests that the fault is ready for the next big earthquake but exactly when the triggering will happen and when the earthquake will occur we can not tell ( ... ) It could be tomorrow or it could be 10 years or more from now . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The Pacific Plate , to the west of the fault , is moving in a northwest direction while the North American Plate to the east is moving toward the southwest , but relatively southeast under the influence of plate tectonics . The rate of slippage averages about 33 to 37 millimeters ( 1.3 to 1.5 in ) a year across California . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Nevertheless , in the ten years since that publication there has not been a substantial quake in the Los Angeles area , and two major reports issued by the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) have made variable predictions as to the risk of future seismic events . The ability to predict major earthquakes with sufficient precision to warrant increased precautions has remained elusive . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Studies of the relative motions of the Pacific and North American plates have shown that only about 75 percent of the motion can be accounted for in the movements of the San Andreas and its various branch faults . The rest of the motion has been found in an area east of the Sierra Nevada mountains called the Walker Lane or Eastern California Shear Zone . The reason for this is not clear . Several hypotheses have been offered and research is ongoing . One hypothesis -- which gained interest following the Landers earthquake in 1992 -- suggests the plate boundary may be shifting eastward away from the San Andreas towards Walker Lane . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The San Andreas Fault System has been the subject of a flood of studies . In particular , scientific research performed during the last 23 years has given rise to about 3,400 publications . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The U.S. Geological Survey most recent forecast , known as UCERF3 ( Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast 3 ) , released in November 2013 , estimated that an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 M or greater ( i.e. equal to or greater than the 1994 Northridge earthquake ) occurs about once every 6.7 years statewide . The same report also estimated there is a 7 % probability that an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or greater will occur in the next 30 years somewhere along the San Andreas Fault . A different USGS study in 2008 tried to assess the physical , social and economic consequences of a major earthquake in southern California . That study predicted that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake along the southern San Andreas Fault could cause about 1,800 deaths and $213 billion in damage . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Assuming the plate boundary does not change as hypothesized , projected motion indicates that the landmass west of the San Andreas Fault , including Los Angeles , will eventually slide past San Francisco , then continue northwestward toward the Aleutian Trench , over a period of perhaps twenty million years . \n",

      "8) Seismologists discovered that the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield in central California consistently produces a magnitude 6.0 earthquake approximately once every 22 years . Following recorded seismic events in 1857 , 1881 , 1901 , 1922 , 1934 , and 1966 , scientists predicted that another earthquake should occur in Parkfield in 1993 . It eventually occurred in 2004 . Due to the frequency of predictable activity , Parkfield has become one of the most important areas in the world for large earthquake research . \n",

      "9) The southwestward motion of the North American Plate towards the Pacific is creating compressional forces along the eastern side of the fault . The effect is expressed as the Coast Ranges . The northwest movement of the Pacific Plate is also creating significant compressional forces which are especially pronounced where the North American Plate has forced the San Andreas to jog westward . This has led to the formation of the Transverse Ranges in Southern California , and to a lesser but still significant extent , the Santa Cruz Mountains ( the location of the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The fault was first identified in Northern California by UC Berkeley geology professor Andrew Lawson in 1895 and named by him after the Laguna de San Andreas , a small lake which lies in a linear valley formed by the fault just south of San Francisco . Eleven years later , Lawson discovered that the San Andreas Fault stretched southward into southern California after reviewing the effects of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . Large - scale ( hundreds of miles ) lateral movement along the fault was first proposed in a 1953 paper by geologists Mason Hill and Thomas Dibblee . This idea , which was considered radical at the time , has since been vindicated by modern plate tectonics . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> During play , a team consists of six players : a goaltender and five `` runners '' . A runner is any non-goalkeeper position player , including forwards , transition players , and defenders . Runners usually specialize in one of these roles and substitute off the field when the ball moves from one end to the other . When the sport originated teams played with six runners . However , in 1953 the sixth runner , a position called rover , was eliminated . The goalkeeper can be replaced by another runner , often when a delayed penalty has been called on the other team or at the end of games by teams that are behind to help score goals . </P>\n",

      "1) The 2015 WILC was hosted by the Onondaga Nation which marks the first time an international sporting event has been held on indigenous land . 13 teams competed in the championship : Australia , Canada , Czech Republic , England , Finland , Germany , Iroquois Nationals , Ireland , Israel , Serbia , Switzerland , Turkey , and the United States . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) During the 2003 NLL season , goaltender Ginny Capicchioni appeared in two preseason and one regular season games to become the only woman to make an appearance in the NLL . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Box lacrosse goal dimensions are traditionally 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) wide by 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) tall . In the NLL , the dimensions are slightly larger at 4 feet 9 inches ( 1.45 m ) wide by 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) tall . These nets are significantly smaller than field lacrosse nets which measure 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) wide by 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) tall . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The 9 feet ( 2.7 m ) to 9 feet 3 inches ( 2.82 m ) radius area surrounding the net is called the `` crease '' . Players except for the goaltender may not enter the crease while playing the ball . Punishments for crease infractions include a change of possession , resetting of the time - clock , or a possible two - minute penalty depending on the infraction . Opposing players may not make contact with the goaltender while he is in the crease . Once he leaves the crease , however , he loses all goaltender privileges . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) A two - minute minor penalty is often called for lesser infractions such as slashing , tripping , elbowing , roughing , too many players , illegal equipment , holding , or interference . Five - minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent , as well as for fighting . Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires , or the opposition scores a goal ( or three goals for the instance of a major penalty ) . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) A transition player is a player whose responsibility is primarily to play during defensive situations with an offensive mindset . The goal of this player is to create fastbreaks and scoring opportunities . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Each period , and after each goal scored , play is restarted with a face - off . If a ball travels over the boards and outside of the playing area , play is restarted by possession being awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) For most penalties , the offending player is sent to the penalty box and his team has to play without him and with one less player for a short amount of time . Most penalties last for two minutes unless a major penalty has been assessed . The team that has taken the penalty is said to be playing shorthanded while the other team is on the power play . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) At the officials ' discretion a ten - minute misconduct penalty may be assessed . These are served in full by the penalized player , but his team may immediately substitute another player on the playing area unless a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct ( a `` two - and - ten '' or `` five - and - ten '' ) . In that case , the team designates another player to serve the minor or major ; both players go to the penalty box , but only the designee may not be replaced , and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes . In addition , game misconducts are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent . A player who receives a game misconduct is ejected and may not return to play . Receiving two major penalties in a game will result in a game misconduct . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) A forward is a player position on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive . Typically , a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other , and will primarily play on that side of the floor . Some players , known as creasemen , do not focus on one side or the other . These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender . \n",

      "1) The three - second rule came about in part following a game at Madison Square Garden between the University of Kentucky ( UK ) and New York University ( NYU ) in 1935 , won by NYU 23 - 22 . The university of Kentucky team did not take their own referee , a common practice at the time , despite advice to the UK coach Adolph Rupp from Notre Dame coach George Keogan , who had lost to NYU the week prior and who warned Rupp of the discrepancies in officiating between the Midwest and the East . The game was rough . UK was unable to run its normal offense ( which consisted of using screens ) without being called for a foul . New York University 's Irving Terjesen and Irwin Klein combined to guard one of UK 's major players , Leroy Edwards , allowing him to score a mere 6 points ( the lowest output of his career ) . The New York Post reacted with alarm : `` The score says that NYU is the best college basketball team in the country and that the East still is supreme . But if Frank Lane , the referee from the Midwest , had worked the game , it 's safe to assume big Leroy Edwards would have been given a fantastic number of foul shots . Minor mayhem was committed on the person of Edwards by Terjesen and Klein . Something will have to be done or the game will become entirely too rough . '' \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> In Europe in the early 15th century the letters `` P '' and `` M '' were generally used . The symbols ( P with line p̄ for più , i.e. , plus , and M with line m̄ for meno , i.e. , minus ) appeared for the first time in Luca Pacioli 's mathematics compendium , Summa de arithmetica , geometria , proportioni et proportionalità , first printed and published in Venice in 1494 . The + is a simplification of the Latin `` et '' ( comparable to the ampersand & ) . The − may be derived from a tilde written over m when used to indicate subtraction ; or it may come from a shorthand version of the letter m itself . In his 1489 treatise Johannes Widmann referred to the symbols − and + as minus and mer ( Modern German mehr ; `` more '' ) : `` was − ist , das ist minus , und das + ist das mer '' . They were n't used for addition and subtraction here , but to indicate surplus and deficit ; their first use in their modern sense appears in a book by Henricus Grammateus in 1518 . </P>\n",

      "\n",
      "2) According to the producers ' DVD commentary for this episode , the original plot for Ross was to have Elizabeth announce that she was pregnant , ultimately resolving at the end of the following season when it would be revealed that Ross was not the father of the baby . This idea was ultimately rejected by the producers since it would be investing a lot of time in a secondary character without a payoff . It would have also have been difficult to use the cliffhanger for Rachel 's pregnancy . \n",

      "3) Rachel takes Phoebe and Joey to a charity event helping children , including a silent auction . While Phoebe is obviously over-drinking ( Phoebe : `` The more I drink , the less there is for the kids to drink ! '' ) , Joey has bigger problems ; misunderstanding the silent auction process , Joey thought that bidders guessed an item 's worth , with the prize going to the person with the closest guess . ( Rachel : Why would a charity give away a free boat ? Joey : I do n't know ... charity ? ) Joey `` guesses '' $20,000 and `` wins '' a yacht . Rachel and Joey try to convince the next highest bidder to buy the boat , but in the process of persuading the man of the boat 's virtues , Joey changes his mind and wants it for himself , although he can barely afford it . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The episode very nearly served as the series finale , given that NBC and Warner Bros. were in negotiations over the show 's future up until four days before the episode aired .

After Joey confirms to Monica that Chandler seemingly has no interest in getting married , Monica decides enough is enough and goes to meet Richard - she describes his apartment as `` a grown - up 's apartment '' and talks to him about the unfairness of the situation . Joey meanwhile tells Chandler how his plan has backfired on him and he is now in serious danger of losing Monica for good , and he leaves on a frantic search intending to propose when he finds her . After Monica leaves Richard 's apartment , Chandler comes and asks for Monica - he starts off by saying that Richard is a very bad man and he had his chances but he blew them . He also says that he and Monica are meant to be together and now Richard has blown Chandler 's chances , revealing he 'd intended to propose .

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> In the late 1700s , traffic in the United States was RHT based on teamsters ' use of large freight wagons pulled by several pairs of horses . The wagons had no driver 's seat , so the ( typically right - handed ) postilion held his whip in his right hand and thus sat on the left rear horse . Seated on the left , the driver preferred that other wagons pass him on the left so that he could be sure to keep clear of the wheels of oncoming wagons . </P>\n",

      "1) There is no technical reason to prefer one side over the other . In healthy populations , traffic safety is thought to be the same regardless of handedness , although some researchers have speculated that LHT may be safer for ageing populations since humans are more commonly right - eye dominant than left - eye dominant . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Vehicles entering and leaving Macau cross over each other at the Lotus Bridge . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) In specialised cases , the driver will sit on the nearside , or kerbside . Examples include : \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Both North Korea and South Korea switched to RHT in September 1945 after liberation from Japan which was defeated and surrendered by the Allies . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Meanwhile , LHT was introduced by the British in Atlantic Canada , Australia , New Zealand , the East Africa Protectorate , British India , Southern Rhodesia and the Cape Colony ( now Zimbabwe and South Africa ) , British Malaya ( now Malaysia , Brunei and Singapore ) , British Guiana , and British Hong Kong . LHT was also introduced by the Portuguese Empire in Portuguese Macau , Colonial Brazil , East Timor , Portuguese Mozambique , and Angola . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) LHT Thailand has three RHT neighbours : Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar . Most of its borders use a simple traffic light to do the switch , but there are also interchanges which enable the switch while keeping up a continuous flow of traffic . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Without sidecars attached , motorcycles , motor scooters , mopeds , and bicycles are almost symmetric with their handlebars in the centre . However , motorcycles are often equipped with automotive - type asymmetrical - beam headlamps that likewise require adjustments or replacement when brought into a country with opposite traffic - handedness . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Of the 193 countries currently recognised by the United Nations ( and the unrecognised Palestine ) , 140 use RHT and 54 use LHT . A country and its territories and dependencies is counted once . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Some crash test results indicate that the RHD variant of a vehicle primarily developed for a LHD country may not protect the driver as well as the LHD variant , although differences in testing methodology could also cause the results to vary . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Because blackout strips and adhesive prismatic lenses reduce the safety performance of the headlamps , most countries require all vehicles registered or used on a permanent or semi-permanent basis within the country to be equipped with headlamps designed for the correct traffic - handedness . \n",

      "3) Several groups exist outside the strict hierarchy of the barons . Nomads are the most common , mostly lawless homicidal bandits who subsist on stealing from trade convoys between the baronies but some live in organized clans . The River King and his men control water trade in the Badlands and beyond , and is considered a neutral party in the barons ' power struggles . An ascetic religious movement called the Totemists is also shown to exist on the fringes of society , living in isolated communities and practicing a form of idol worship . The Widow leads a revolutionary group of anti-feudal fighters from her late husband 's barony ; although nominally recognized as a baron by her peers , they do not respect her , and the contempt is mutual . \n",

      "4) The series is set in a post-apocalyptic world approximately 500 years after a war that left civilization in ruins . Many elements of technology , such as electricity and ground vehicles , have survived the apocalypse but society now shuns guns , leading to a reliance on melee weaponry . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) In a territory known as the Badlands , the former state of Oklahoma , a feudal society has developed to fill the power vacuum left by the war . Barons control land and monopolies over commodities like opium and fuel , trading amongst themselves to maintain the peace . Each baron is served by a massive workforce of slaves called cogs , as well as a prostitute class called dolls . A baron maintains power through a corps of young men and women called clippers : highly trained and loyal warriors . clippers are forbidden from marrying and having children lest their loyalties be divided .

      "9) Episode eleven is written by Stephanie Hicks & Matt Lambert , and directed by Tricia Brock . \n",

      "10) Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter gave a generally positive review and wrote , `` AMC finds a bloody , fun and entertaining non-zombie counterpart to The Walking Dead and turns Sundays into an escapist red zone . '' Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote , `` The action scenes scattered throughout Into the Badlands are not just stirringly presented , they represent a test passed with flying , and bloody , colors . This efficient AMC series is an homage to classic Samurai films and kinetic action fare churned out by Hong Kong maestros of furious fists , and if the TV drama had failed to meet the standards set by the sturdiest examples of those genres , it would have seemed superfluous at best . Fortunately , star Daniel Wu is more than up to the task of occupying the center of this streamlined story of vengeance , tyranny and roundhouse kicks . '' \n",

      "1) ... One thing I do n't think I explained in the script book was that I was also teasing the typist , Geoffrey ( Perkins ) 's secretary , because ... she 'd be typing out this long and extraordinary name which would be quite an effort to type and right at the beginning he says ' My name is not important , and I 'm not going to tell you what it is ' .

He is unhappy about this because he has begun `` doing it with fjords again '' ( arguing that they give a continent a lovely baroque feel ) , but has been told by his superiors that they are `` not equatorial enough '' . \n",

      "8) Douglas Adams writes in the notes accompanying the published volume of original radio scripts that he wanted Slartibartfast 's name to sound very rude , but still actually be broadcastable .

      "\u001b[1mQuestion 57: name some components of the central nervous system (cns) ?\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> The central nervous system ( CNS ) is the part of the nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord . The central nervous system is so named because it integrates information it receives from , and coordinates and influences the activity of , all parts of the bodies of bilaterally symmetric animals -- that is , all multicellular animals except sponges and radially symmetric animals such as jellyfish -- and it contains the majority of the nervous system . Many consider the retina and the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , as well as the olfactory nerves ( cranial nerve I ) and olfactory epithelium as parts of the CNS , synapsing directly on brain tissue without intermediate ganglia . As such , the olfactory epithelium is the only central nervous tissue in direct contact with the environment , which opens up for therapeutic treatments . The CNS is contained within the dorsal body cavity , with the brain housed in the cranial cavity and the spinal cord in the spinal canal . In vertebrates , the brain is protected by the skull , while the spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae . The brain and spinal cord are both enclosed in the meninges . In central nervous systems , the interneuronal space is filled with a large amount of supporting non-nervous cells called neuroglial cells . </P>\n",

      "\n",
      "4) Mammals -- which appear in the fossil record after the first fishes , amphibians , and reptiles -- are the only vertebrates to possess the evolutionarily recent , outermost part of the cerebral cortex known as the neocortex . The neocortex of monotremes ( the duck - billed platypus and several species of spiny anteaters ) and of marsupials ( such as kangaroos , koalas , opossums , wombats , and Tasmanian devils ) lack the convolutions -- gyri and sulci -- found in the neocortex of most placental mammals ( eutherians ) . Within placental mammals , the size and complexity of the neocortex increased over time . The area of the neocortex of mice is only about 1 / 100 that of monkeys , and that of monkeys is only about 1 / 10 that of humans . In addition , rats lack convolutions in their neocortex ( possibly also because rats are small mammals ) , whereas cats have a moderate degree of convolutions , and humans have quite extensive convolutions . Extreme convolution of the neocortex is found in dolphins , possibly related to their complex echolocation . \n",

      "\u001b[1mQuestion 58: who's the director of the price is right ?\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> The game show production team of Mark Goodson and Bill Todman was responsible for producing the original as well as the revival versions of the game show . Goodson - Todman staffer Bob Stewart is credited with creating the original version of The Price Is Right . Roger Dobkowitz was the producer from 1984 to 2008 , having worked with the program as a production staffer since the show 's debut after graduating from San Francisco State University . Occasionally , Dobkowitz appeared on - camera when answering a question posed by the host , usually relating to the show 's history or records . When he left the show at the end of season 36 , Variety reported that it was unclear whether he was retiring or was fired , although Carey indicated in a later interview with Esquire that Dobkowitz was fired . As of 2011 , the show uses multiple producers , all long - time staffers . Adam Sandler ( not to be confused with the actor ) is the producer of the show . Stan Blits , who joined the show in 1980 and Sue MacIntyre are the co-producers . Kathy Greco joined the show in 1975 and became producer in 2008 ; she announced her retirement October 8 , 2010 on the show 's website , effective at the end of the December 2010 tapings . Her last episode as producer , which aired January 27 , 2011 , featured a theme in tribute to her . The show 's official website featured a series of videos including an interview with Greco as a tribute to her 35 years in the days leading up to her final episode . Frank Wayne , a Goodson - Todman staffer since the 1950s , was the original executive producer of the CBS version of the show . Barker assumed that role after Wayne 's death in March 1988 , as previously stated . Previous producers have included Jay Wolpert , Barbara Hunter and Phil Wayne Rossi ( Wayne 's son ) . Michael Dimich assumed the director 's chair in June 2011 . Marc Breslow , Paul Alter , Bart Eskander and Rich DiPirro each served long stints previously as director . Former associate directors Andrew Felsher and Fred Witten , as well as technical director Glenn Koch , have directed episodes strictly on a fill - in basis . Sandler began directing episodes in 2012 , and became the official director in 2013 . Aside from Barker , the show 's production staff remained intact after Carey became host . FremantleMedia executive Syd Vinnedge was named the program 's new executive producer , with Richards becoming co-executive producer after Dobkowitz 's departure . Richards was a candidate to replace Barker as host in 2007 , before Carey was ultimately chosen . Richards succeeded Vinnedge as executive producer when the 2009 -- 10 season started , with Tracy Verna Soiseth joining Richards as co-executive producer in 2010 . Vinnedge remains credited as an executive consultant to the show . </P>\n",

      "1) A series of video slot machines were manufactured for North American casinos by International Game Technology . Although gameplay varies by machine , each feature themes and motifs found on the show , including the Showcase Showdown , with themes used following Carey 's start as host . Others feature pricing games as gameplay elements , including Plinko , Cliff Hangers , Punch a Bunch , Dice Game , and Money Game . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The show 's early reception was not as universally positive , as critics lamented the show 's stark departure from the highbrow norms of the Golden Age of Television ; original nighttime host Dennis James admitted that even his own housekeeper did not watch the show for that reason , but also defended the series , saying `` CBS , who never wanted game shows , just put three game shows on the air , so they know they had better join the fight or lose out , because game shows have a tremendous appeal . The critics will always look down their noses , but you ca n't have The Bell Telephone Hour on and still stay in competition ( ... ) If you want to read books , read books . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Occasionally , episodes are taped with special audience restrictions . For Memorial Day in 1991 , an episode was taped with an audience composed entirely of those who had served in the Armed Forces . Similar primetime episodes were taped in 2002 , honoring each branch of the United States military and a sixth episode honoring police officers and firefighters . An annual military episode has been taped starting Season 38 in 2008 , originally on Veteran 's Day , but moved in Season 41 ( 2013 ) to Independence Day , features an all - military audience , a Marine band playing the winner 's service anthem , and contestants being called by rank . The 2008 episode contained a unique rule in which each One Bid featured one contestant from the Army , Navy , Air Force and Marines , and One Bid winners also won a $1,000 gift card . As each contestant won his / her way onstage , he / she was replaced by a member of the same branch of service . Most civilian attendees were retired or disabled veterans or family members of military . The 2009 version eliminated the service member from the same branch replacing another after advancing from Contestants ' Row rule . Additionally , members from the United States Coast Guard were invited to the show . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Beginning in 2009 , some episodes have featured special themes with two contestants competing as teams , such as married or engaged couples for Valentine 's Day and the `` Ultimate Wedding Shower '' episode . There have also been episodes with children who are minors ( normally not allowed to compete ) teamed with a parent ( for Mother 's Day and Father 's Day ) or grandparent ( for Grandparents Day ) , as well as teen drivers and students for `` Ultimate Spring Break '' and `` Back to School '' . In these cases the adult player ( not the minor ) must make all final decisions in the game play , such as when calling numbers or prices . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) CBS attempted to break NBC 's dominance of Thursday night prime time by The Cosby Show and Family Ties with a six - episode summer series , The Price Is Right Special , beginning in August 1986 . On August 23 , 1996 , CBS aired an hour - long 25th Anniversary Special , using the half - hour gameplay format and featuring a number of retrospective clips . The 30th Anniversary Special was recorded at Harrah 's Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and aired on January 31 , 2002 . This one - time road trip enticed 5,000 potential contestants to line up for 900 available tickets , causing an incident that left one person injured . A second six - episode primetime series saluting various branches of the United States armed forces , police officers and firefighters aired during the summer of 2002 , as a tribute to the heroes of the terrorist attacks of 2001 . During the series The Price Is Right Salutes , spinning $1.00 in a bonus spin during the Showcase Showdown was worth $100,000 instead of the usual $10,000 . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Eight years after the cancellation of Kennedy 's Price Is Right , a new syndicated version premiered on September 12 , 1994 , hosted by Doug Davidson and distributed by Paramount Domestic Television . This series featured several significant changes : eliminating Contestants ' Row , a different format for the Showcase Showdown , a Showcase featuring only one contestant , a completely different set and a much larger budget ( even when compared to the two previous syndicated runs ) that gave contestants the potential to win up to five times what they could win on the daytime show . However , this version found even more trouble finding an audience than the two previous syndicated series did and ended its run on January 27 , 1995 , after only 16 weeks of first - run shows . Several stylistic elements of this series , as well as many of its music cues , were later integrated into both the daytime version and nighttime specials . \n",

      "\n",
      "8) Like its predecessor , this syndicated edition of Price was intended to be aired in the Prime Time Access slots on local stations . However , local stations found themselves bombarded with game shows and other series looking for spots on stations in an increasingly crowded market . This often resulted in shows like Price airing anywhere that they could be fit into a station 's programming lineup , such as in the early morning period or in late - night slots . As a consequence , the show would not be able to find its intended audience and the ratings reports would reflect this . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The Price Is Right premiered on September 4 , 1972 at 10 : 30 am ET ( 9 : 30 CT ) on CBS , one of three game shows to debut that day , the other two being The Joker 's Wild at 10 : 00 am ET and Gambit at 11 : 00 am ET . The show was first billed as The New Price Is Right to distinguish itself from the earlier / original version ( 1956 -- 65 ) hosted by Bill Cullen , but it proved so popular in its own right that , in June 1973 , the producers decided to drop the word `` New '' from its title . On March 26 , 1973 , CBS moved The Price Is Right to 3 : 00 pm ET , pairing it with Match Game as part of what became the highest - rated pairing in daytime . The show remained in that time slot until August 11 , 1975 when it permanently returned to the morning lineup at 10 : 30am ET . During one week ( September 8 -- 12 , 1975 ) , the show bumped Gambit off as it experimented with sixty - minute episodes . The result of the experiment led to the permanent expansion on November 3 , 1975 , moving its start time to 10 : 00 am EST . On March 7 , 1977 , The Price Is Right moved back to 10 : 30am and remained there until April 23 , 1979 , when it assumed its 11 : 00 am EST slot , where it has been since then . The format of the show has since remained virtually unchanged . New pricing games are generally added each year , while others are removed . In addition , prizes and pricing games have kept pace with inflation , with games originally designed for four - digit prices of prizes ( most often cars ) to be adjusted to allow for five - digit prices . While the set has been redesigned and upgraded , the show maintained a similar aesthetic element from its premiere in 1972 . In season 36 , CBS began offering full episodes of the show available for free viewing on the network 's website . The show also began broadcasting in high definition with The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular primetime specials ( the normal daytime version continued to air in 4 : 3 standard definition ) . The show made the full transition to HD broadcasts beginning with season 37 . During the weeks of September 28 , 2009 , September 20 and October 4 , 2010 , two new episodes aired each weekday on CBS . In 2009 , the additional episodes filled a gap between the cancellation of the daytime drama Guiding Light and the debut of Let 's Make a Deal . In 2010 , the extra episodes aired between the cancellation of As the World Turns and the debut of The Talk . The intervening week offered a second episode of Let 's Make a Deal . The 2009 second episode aired in the time slot vacated by Guiding Light at 10 : 00 am or 3 : 00 pm ET / PT , depending on the affiliate 's choice . In 2010 , the second episode aired in the former As the World Turns time slot , at 2 : 00 pm ET / PT . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) On February 12 , 2016 , CBS announced that it would air three primetime Price is Right specials themed around its reality show franchises The Amazing Race , Big Brother , and Survivor along with the appearance of their respective hosts from all three franchises Phil Keoghan , Julie Chen and Jeff Probst . The episodes featured fans of the three programs playing alongside past participants from them . The specials were filmed in March 2016 , and aired over three consecutive nights , May 23 -- 25 , 2016 . \n",

Shears is appalled at the idea of returning to a place from which he nearly died during escape . He confesses he is not an officer , but merely had appropriated an officer 's uniform prior to his capture , expecting that this revelation will invalidate the transfer order . However , Warden responds he already knew the truth and tells Shears that the American Navy 's desire to avoid dealing with the embarrassment of his actions is the very reason they agreed to his transfer . Assured that he will be allowed to retain the privileges of being an officer and accepting that he actually has no choice , Shears relents and `` volunteers '' for the mission . The commando team consists of four men . \n",

      "9) A memorable feature of the film is the tune that is whistled by the POWs -- the first strain of the march `` Colonel Bogey '' -- when they enter the camp .

'' Wise : `` I never heard it in Thailand . We had n't much breath left for whistling . But in Bangkok I was told that David Lean , the film 's director , became mad at the extras who played the prisoners -- us -- because they could n't march in time .

Strumming a guitar , trying to write their next song , they were coming up empty . `` As we tried to find another way to say nothing , we came up with the song , '' Overstreet later told author Ace Collins .

Pakistan was the second country to be suspended , on 18 October 1999 , following the military coup by Pervez Musharraf . The Commonwealth 's longest suspension came to an end on 22 May 2004 , when Pakistan 's suspension was lifted following the restoration of the country 's constitution . Pakistan was suspended for a second time , far more briefly , for six months from 22 November 2007 , when Musharraf called a state of emergency . Zimbabwe was suspended in 2002 over concerns regarding the electoral and land reform policies of Robert Mugabe 's ZANU - PF government , before it withdrew from the organisation in 2003 . \n",

The mechanisms by which these principles would be applied were created , and the manner clarified , by the 1995 Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme , which created the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group ( CMAG ) , which has the power to rule on whether members meet the requirements for membership under the Harare Declaration . Also in 1995 , an Inter-Governmental Group was created to finalise and codify the full requirements for membership . Upon reporting in 1997 , as adopted under the Edinburgh Declaration , the Inter-Governmental Group ruled that any future members would have to have a direct constitutional link with an existing member . \n",

      "\u001b[1mQuestion 63: where can pulse be felt in the body ?\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> In medicine , a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat by trained fingertips . The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body , such as at the neck ( carotid artery ) , wrist ( radial artery ) , at the groin ( femoral artery ) , behind the knee ( popliteal artery ) , near the ankle joint ( posterior tibial artery ) , and on foot ( dorsalis pedis artery ) . Pulse ( or the count of arterial pulse per minute ) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate . The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by auscultation , traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute . The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers . This has a reason : the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure , the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure , and the finger most distal to the heart ( usually the ring finger ) is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches ( superficial and deep ) . The study of the pulse is known as sphygmology . </P>\n",

      "\n",
      "2) Pulse velocity , pulse deficits and much more physiologic data are readily and simplistically visualized by the use of one or more arterial catheters connected to a transducer and oscilloscope . This invasive technique has been commonly used in intensive care since the 1970s . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The first person to accurately measure the pulse rate was Santorio Santorii who invented the pulsilogium , a form of pendulum , based on the work by Galileo Galilei . A century later another physician , de Lacroix , used the pulsilogium to test cardiac function . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Comparing pulses and different places gives valuable clinical information . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Several pulse patterns can be of clinically significance . These include : \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The rate of the pulse is observed and measured by tactile or visual means on the outside of an artery and is recorded as beats per minute or BPM . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) A discrepant or unequal pulse between left and right radial artery is observed in anomalous or aberrant course of artery , coarctation of aorta , aortitis , dissecting aneurysm , peripheral embolism etc . An unequal pulse between upper and lower extremities is seen in coarctation to aorta , aortitis , block at bifurcation of aorta , dissection of aorta , iatrogenic trauma and arteriosclerotic obstruction . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Chinese medicine has focused on the pulse in the upper limbs for several centuries . The concept of pulse diagnosis is essentially based on palpation and observations of the radial and ulnar volar pulses at the readily accessible wrist . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Pressure waves generated by the heart in systole move the arterial walls . Forward movement of blood occurs when the boundaries are pliable and compliant . These properties form enough to create a palpable pressure wave . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) A normal artery is not palpable after flattening by digital pressure . A thick radial artery which is palpable 7.5 -- 10 cm up the forearm is suggestive of arteriosclerosis . \n",

      "2) The stadium , also designed by Frederick Heath , dates from 1910 and is in a location once known as Old Woman 's Gulch . It was originally much grander than it is today , with a seating capacity of 32,000 . Among those who spoke there were Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson , Warren G. Harding , William Jennings Bryan , and Billy Sunday . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The stadium was originally built in 1909 -- 1910 using steam shovels and sluicing to move more than 180,000 cubic yards ( 140,000 m ) down the edges of the gulch to create a flat playing field of 2.5 acres ( 10,000 m ) . Wooden molds were built to cast concrete for 31 rows of stadium seating surrounding the playfield . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The original structure exceeded what the soil could support . A restoration project in the 1970s had to sacrifice roughly half of the seating capacity because of instability . In 1981 a burst storm drain washed away the scoreboard and the bayward end zone of the football field . This was followed by a further restoration allowing the stadium to reopen in 1985 . \n",

      "5) Every year , Stadium participates in the Pierce County Daffodil Festival . A competition is held in house to select the Stadium Princess , who goes on to compete against other regional schools , for the Daffodil Festival Queen title . The Queen title is considered the highest honor of the regional festival . The Stadium band accompanies the float of Stadium 's princesses every year in the parade , held annually in April . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The main building was constructed by architects Hewitt and Hewitt for the Northern Pacific Railroad Company and the Tacoma Land Company at what was then known as Blackwell Point . Construction began in 1891 with the intention of building a luxury hotel resembling a French château . The Panic of 1893 , however , brought construction to an abrupt halt when the Northern Pacific was faced with financial disaster . The unfinished building became a storage facility , with much of the building materials still inside . On October 11 , 1898 , the building was gutted by a massive fire . The walls remained standing , and the Northern Pacific began to dismantle the structure , removing some 40,000 bricks that would be used to construct still - existing train stations in Missoula , Montana , and Wallace , Idaho . \n",

      "8) The reconstructed building opened on September 10 , 1906 , as Tacoma High School . Seven years later , the name was changed to reference the adjacent Stadium Bowl . Later additions included a circular lunchroom , an underground swimming pool , a science and industrial arts complex , a gymnasium , and a multi-story parking lot structure with tennis courts on the roof . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In 2005 - 2006 the school underwent a major renovation , seismic upgrade , historical restoration , and expansion . Bassetti Architects were the design architects , and Merrit Pardini Architects ( later Krei Architecture ) were the architects of record for this work . During the renovation , students were temporarily relocated to the old site of Mount Tahoma High School in the south end , just over 7 miles ( 11 km ) away . \n",

      "10) In the years of 2006 and 2007 , no one in Tacoma submitted a float , a requirement for participation in the festival . The festival board waived the requirement , but in 2008 warned that if no group within Tacoma School District boundaries presented a float , Tacoma and its students , including the Royal Court program , would be barred from participation in the 2009 parade . In response , the Stadium High School Environmental Club decided to build a float , ensuring Stadium and other area schools inclusion in the Daffodil Festival for 2009 . \n",

      "7) The WWE Championship is a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship in WWE , currently on the SmackDown brand . It is the first world title established in WWE , having been introduced in 1963 as the World Wide Wrestling Federation ( WWWF ) World Heavyweight Championship . The promotion was renamed World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) in 1979 and ended its affiliation with the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) in 1983 , with the title also renamed to reflect the changes . In 2001 , it was unified with the World Championship ( formerly the WCW World Heavyweight Championship ) following the WWF 's buyout of World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) and became the Undisputed WWF Championship . In 2002 , the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) and split its roster into two brands , Raw and SmackDown . The title , now renamed WWE Championship , was then designated to the SmackDown brand while WWE established an alternate world title known as the World Heavyweight Championship for the Raw brand . A third alternate world title , the ECW World Heavyweight Championship , was reactivated for the ECW brand in 2006 . It was vacated and decommissioned when the ECW brand disbanded in 2010 . \n",

It began on Friday , 2 April 1982 , when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands ( and , the following day , South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands ) in an attempt to establish the sovereignty it had claimed over them . On 5 April , the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands . The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with the Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982 , returning the islands to British control .

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Intentional repetition of meaning intends to amplify or emphasize a particular , usually significant , fact about what is being discussed . For example , a gift is , by definition , free of charge ; using the phrase `` free gift '' might emphasize that there are no hidden conditions or fine print , be it the expectation of money or reciprocation , or that the gift is being given by volition . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Like pleonasm , it is often considered a fault of style when unintentional . On the other hand , an intentional repetition may be an effective way to emphasize a thought , or help the listener or reader understand a point . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Sometimes logical tautologies like `` Boys will be boys '' are conflated with language tautologies , but in general , a rhetorical tautology is not inherently true . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The use of tautologies is , however , usually unintentional . For example , the phrases `` mental telepathy '' , `` planned conspiracies '' , and `` small dwarfs '' imply that there are such things as `` physical telepathy , spontaneous conspiracies , and giant dwarfs . '' ) \n",
      "\n",
      "5)Tautology ( language ) - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Parallelism is not tautology , but rather a particular stylistic device . Much Old Testament poetry is based on parallelism : the same thing said twice , but in slightly different ways ( Fowler puts it as pleonasm ) . However , modern biblical study emphasizes that there are subtle distinctions and developments between the two lines , such that they are usually not truly the `` same thing . '' Parallelism can be found wherever there is poetry in the Bible : Psalms , the Books of the Prophets , and in other areas as well . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The word was coined in Hellenistic Greek from ταὐτός ' the same plus λόγος ' word / idea '. , and transmitted through 3rd - century Latin tautologia and French tautologie . It first appears in English in the 16th century . The use in the term logical tautology was introduced in English by Wittgenstein in 1919 , perhaps following Auguste Comte 's usage in 1835 . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) In literary criticism and rhetoric , a tautology is a statement which repeats the same idea , using near - synonymous morphemes , words , or phrases , that is , `` saying the same thing twice '' . Tautology and pleonasm are not consistently differentiated in the literature . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) This is related to the rhetorical device of hendiadys , where one concept is expressed through the use of two descriptive words or phrases . For example , `` goblets and gold '' meaning wealth , or `` this day and age '' meaning the present time . Superficially these expressions may seem tautological , but they are stylistically sound because the repeated meaning is just a way to emphasize the same idea . \n",

      "1) Due to the nature of complex systems , the high - level description will often be completely different from the low level one . For example , there are features to an ant colony that are not features of any individual ant ; features of the human mind that are not known to be descriptive of individual neurons in the brain , features of oceans which are not features of any individual water molecule , and features to a human personality that are not features of any cell in a body . The descriptions of these differ depending at what level they are studied . Features which emerge only at a high level of description are known as epiphenomena . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) High - level and low - level are typically terms used to classify , describe and point to specific goals of a systematic operation , though its uses also vary depending on the context - such as use in computer science versus business administration . In general , high - level is used to describe operations that are more abstract in nature , where overall goals and systemic features are typically more concerned with the wider , macro system as a whole . Alternatively , a low - level description is one that describes more specific individual components of a systematic operation , focusing on the details of rudimentary micro functions rather than macro , complex processes . Low - level classification is typically more concerned with individual components within the system and how they operate . \n",

      "3) Between 1917 and 1939 Carl Orff also wrote incidental music for a German version of the play , Ein Sommernachtstraum ( performed in 1939 ) . Since Mendelssohn 's parents were Jews who converted to Lutheranism , his music had been banned by the Nazi regime , and the Nazi cultural officials put out a call for new music for the play : Orff was one of the musicians who responded . He later reworked the music for a final version , completed in 1964 . \n",

      "5) Gervinus wrote with elitist disdain about the mechanicals of the play and their acting aspirations . He described them as homely creatures with `` hard hands and thick heads '' . They are , in his view , ignorant men who compose and act in plays merely for financial reward . They are not real artists . Gervinus reserves his praise and respect only for Theseus , who he thinks represents the intellectual man . Like several of his predecessors , Gervinus thought that this work should be read as a text and not acted on stage . \n",

      "6) In 1849 , Charles Knight also wrote about the play and its apparent lack of proper social stratification . He thought that this play indicated Shakespeare 's maturity as a playwright , and that its `` Thesean harmony '' reflects proper decorum of character . He also viewed Bottom as the best - drawn character , with his self - confidence , authority , and self - love . He argued that Bottom stands as a representative of the whole human race . Like Hazlitt he felt that the work is best appreciated when read as a text , rather than acted on stage . He found the writing to be `` subtle and ethereal '' , and standing above literary criticism and its reductive reasoning . \n",

      "8) In 1839 , the philosopher Hermann Ulrici wrote that the play and its depiction of human life reflected the views of Platonism . In his view , Shakespeare implied that human life is nothing but a dream , suggesting influence from Plato and his followers who thought human reality is deprived of all genuine existence . Ulrici noted the way Theseus and Hippolyta behave here , like ordinary people . He agreed with Malone that this did not fit their stations in life , but viewed this behaviour as an indication of parody about class differences . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Also in 1971 , Andrew D. Weiner argued that the play 's actual theme is unity . The poet 's imagination creates unity by giving form to diverse elements , and the writer is addressing the spectator 's own imagination which also creates and perceives unity . Weiner connected this unity to the concept of uniformity , and in turn viewed this as Shakespeare 's allusion to the `` eternal truths '' of Platonism and Christianity . \n",

      "2) There are commonly three pillars to valuing business entities : comparable company analyses , discounted cash flow analysis , and precedent transaction analysis . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Businesses or fractional interests in businesses may be valued for various purposes such as mergers and acquisitions , sale of securities , and taxable events . An accurate valuation of privately owned companies largely depends on the reliability of the firm 's historic financial information . Public company financial statements are audited by Certified Public Accountants ( USA ) , Chartered Certified Accountants ( ACCA ) or Chartered Accountants ( UK and Canada ) and overseen by a government regulator . Alternatively , private firms do not have government oversight -- unless operating in a regulated industry -- and are usually not required to have their financial statements audited . Moreover , managers of private firms often prepare their financial statements to minimize profits and , therefore , taxes . Alternatively , managers of public firms tend to want higher profits to increase their stock price . Therefore , a firm 's historic financial information may not be accurate and can lead to over - and undervaluation . In an acquisition , a buyer often performs due diligence to verify the seller 's information . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Valuations of intangible assets are often necessary for financial reporting and intellectual property transactions . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Many price multiples can be calculated . Most are based on a financial statement element such as a firm 's earnings ( price - to - earnings ) or book value ( price - to - book value ) but multiples can be based on other factors such as price - per - subscriber . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In finance theory , the amount of the opportunity cost is based on a relation between the risk and return of some sort of investment . Classic economic theory maintains that people are rational and averse to risk . They , therefore , need an incentive to accept risk . The incentive in finance comes in the form of higher expected returns after buying a risky asset . In other words , the more risky the investment , the more return investors want from that investment . Using the same example as above , assume the first investment opportunity is a government bond that will pay interest of 5 % per year and the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the government . Alternatively , the second investment opportunity is a bond issued by small company and that bond also pays annual interest of 5 % . If given a choice between the two bonds , virtually all investors would buy the government bond rather than the small - firm bond because the first is less risky while paying the same interest rate as the riskier second bond . In this case , an investor has no incentive to buy the riskier second bond . Furthermore , in order to attract capital from investors , the small firm issuing the second bond must pay an interest rate higher than 5 % that the government bond pays . Otherwise , no investor is likely to buy that bond and , therefore , the firm will be unable to raise capital . But by offering to pay an interest rate more than 5 % the firm gives investors an incentive to buy a riskier bond . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Depending on context , Real options valuation techniques are also sometimes employed ; for further discussion here see Business valuation : Option pricing approaches , Corporate finance : Valuing flexibility , as well as Mineral economics in general . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Startup companies such as Uber , which was valued at $50 billion in early 2015 , have a valuation based on what investors , for the most part venture capital firms , are willing to pay for a share of the firm . They are not listed on any stock market , nor is the valuation based on their assets or profits , but on their potential for success , growth , and eventually , possible profits . Many startup companies use internal growth factors to show their potential growth which may attribute to their valuation . The professional investors who fund startups are experts , but hardly infallible , see Dot - com bubble . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Users of valuations benefit when key information , assumptions , and limitations are disclosed to them . Then they can weigh the degree of reliability of the result and make their decision . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The International Valuation Standards include definitions for common bases of value and generally accepted practice procedures for valuing assets of all types . \n",

      "1) At a discreet meeting with Greene , Michael expresses his disapproval and makes an offer to buy out Greene 's entire interest in the casino as part of the Corleones ' relocation to Nevada . Offended , Greene angrily refuses , claiming that the Corleones have neither the favor nor the power required to drive him out of the business and are only moving to Las Vegas because the other families are chasing them out of New York . In the film , he also belittles Michael 's credentials as a Don , saying , `` I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders ! '' \n",

      "5) Morris Greene is a fictional character appearing in Mario Puzo 's 1969 novel The Godfather and the 1972 movie of the same name . The character 's name is a composite of real Las Vegas mobsters Moe Dalitz , or possibly Moe Sedway , and Gus Greenbaum . However , both Greene 's character and personality are actually based on Bugsy Siegel : his affiliation with the mob in Los Angeles , his involvement in the development of Las Vegas , and his flamboyant tendencies . Greene is portrayed in the movie by Alex Rocco . \n",

      "9) Greene is introduced in The Godfather as a renowned Jewish mobster and former executioner for Murder , Inc . He is credited with the development of gambling and entertainment in Las Vegas and bringing the interests of the most powerful organized crime organizations in America to Nevada . Greene is in business with Don Vito Corleone , who bankrolls the creation of Greene 's first hotel - casino . In return , Greene takes the Don 's son Fredo under his wing during the war between the Five Families in New York , due to the intervention of West Coast Don Francesco . Although Fredo is greatly influenced by both Greene and the city , family heir Michael Corleone disapproves of the effect it has on his brother , whom Greene reportedly chastised and slapped around in public . \n",

      "1) Armstrong and his wife attended the memorial service for the victims of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003 , at the invitation of President George W. Bush . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) In all , Armstrong flew 78 missions over Korea for a total of 121 hours in the air , a third of them in January 1952 , with the final mission on March 5 , 1952 . Of 492 U.S. Navy personnel killed in the Korean War , 27 of them were from the Essex on this war cruise . Armstrong received the Air Medal for 20 combat missions , two gold stars for the next 40 , the Korean Service Medal and Engagement Star , the National Defense Service Medal and the United Nations Korea Medal . His regular commission was terminated on February 25 , 1952 , and he became an ensign in the United States Navy Reserve . On completion of his combat tour with Essex , he was assigned to a transport squadron , VR - 32 , in May 1952 . He was released from active duty on August 23 , 1952 , but remained in the reserves , and was promoted to lieutenant ( junior grade ) on May 9 , 1953 . As a reservist , he continued to fly , with VF - 724 at Naval Air Station Glenview in Illinois , and then , after moving to California , with VF - 773 at Naval Air Station Los Alamitos . He remained in the reserve for eight years , before resigning his commission on October 21 , 1960 . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) On August 29 , 1951 , Armstrong saw action in the Korean War as an escort for a photo reconnaissance plane over Songjin . Five days later , on September 3 , he flew armed reconnaissance over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon - ni , west of Wonsan . Making a low bombing run at 350 mph ( 560 km / h ) , Armstrong 's F9F Panther was hit by anti-aircraft fire . While trying to regain control , he collided with a pole at a height of 20 feet ( 6 m ) , which sliced off 3 feet ( 1 m ) of the Panther 's right wing . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Armstrong 's assignment was to Fleet Aircraft Service Squadron 7 ( FASRON 7 ) at NAS San Diego ( now known as NAS North Island ) . On November 27 , 1950 , he was assigned to VF - 51 , an all - jet squadron , becoming its youngest officer , and made his first flight in a jet , a Grumman F9F Panther , on January 5 , 1951 . He was promoted to ensign on June 5 , 1951 , and made his first jet carrier landing on USS Essex two days later . On June 28 , 1951 , Essex had set sail for Korea , with VF - 51 aboard to act as ground - attack aircraft . VF - 51 flew ahead to Naval Air Station Barbers Point in Hawaii , where it conducted fighter - bomber training before rejoining the ship at the end of July . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Along with spokesman duties , he also served on the board of directors of several companies . The first company which Armstrong joined the board was Gates Learjet , chairing their technical committee . He flew their new and experimental jets and even set a climb and altitude record for business jets . Armstrong became a member of Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company 's board in 1973 . They were interested in nuclear power and wanted to increase the company 's technical competence . He served on the board of Taft Broadcasting , also based in Cincinnati . Armstrong joined Thiokol 's board in 1989 , after he was vice-chair of the Rogers Commission ; the Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed due to a problem with the Thiokol - manufactured solid rocket boosters . When Armstrong left the University of Cincinnati , he became the chairman of Cardwell International Ltd. , a company that manufactured drilling rigs . He served on additional aerospace boards , first United Airlines in 1978 and later Eaton Corporation in 1980 . He was asked to chair the board of directors for a subsidiary of Eaton , AIL Systems . He chaired the board through the company 's 2000 merger with EDO Corporation , until his retirement in 2002 . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) While working at his farm near Lebanon , Ohio , in November 1978 , Armstrong jumped off the back of his grain truck and his wedding ring got caught in the wheel , tearing off the tip of his left hand 's ring finger . He collected the severed digit and packed it in ice , and surgeons reattached it at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville , Kentucky . In February 1991 , a year after his father had died , and nine months after the death of his mother , he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing with friends at Aspen , Colorado . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) On May 21 , 1962 , Armstrong was involved in the `` Nellis Affair '' . He was sent in an F - 104 to inspect Delamar Dry Lake in southern Nevada , again for emergency landings . He misjudged his altitude , and did not realize that the landing gear had not fully extended . As he touched down , the landing gear began to retract ; Armstrong applied full power to abort the landing , but the ventral fin and landing gear door struck the ground , damaging the radio and releasing hydraulic fluid . Without radio communication , Armstrong flew south to Nellis Air Force Base , past the control tower , and waggled his wings , the signal for a no - radio approach . The loss of hydraulic fluid caused the tailhook to release , and upon landing , he caught the arresting wire attached to an anchor chain , and dragged the chain along the runway . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Following the flight , President Lyndon B. Johnson asked Armstrong and his wife to take part in a 24 - day goodwill tour of South America . Also on the tour , which took in 11 countries and 14 major cities , were Dick Gordon , George Low , their wives , and other government officials . In Paraguay , Armstrong greeted dignitaries in their local language , Guarani ; in Brazil he talked about the exploits of the Brazilian - born Alberto Santos - Dumont . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Armstrong underwent bypass surgery on August 7 , 2012 , to relieve blocked coronary arteries . Although he was reportedly recovering well , he developed complications in the hospital and died on August 25 , in Cincinnati , Ohio , aged 82 . After his death , Armstrong was described , in a statement released by the White House , as `` among the greatest of American heroes -- not just of his time , but of all time '' . The statement went on to say that Armstrong had carried the aspirations of the United States ' citizens and that he had delivered `` a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten . '' \n",

      "10) As they climbed to 30,000 feet ( 9 km ) , the number - four engine stopped and the propeller began windmilling ( rotating freely ) in the airstream . Hitting the switch that would stop the propeller 's spinning , Butchart found it slowed but then started spinning again , this time even faster than the others ; if it spun too fast , it would break apart . Their aircraft needed to hold an airspeed of 210 mph ( 338 km / h ) to launch its Skyrocket payload , and the B - 29 could not land with the Skyrocket attached to its belly . Armstrong and Butchart brought the aircraft into a nose - down attitude to increase speed , then launched the Skyrocket . At the instant of launch , the number - four engine propeller disintegrated . Pieces of it damaged the number - three engine and hit the number - two engine . Butchart and Armstrong were forced to shut down the damaged number - three engine , along with the number - one engine , due to the torque it created . They made a slow , circling descent from 30,000 ft ( 9 km ) using only the number - two engine , and landed safely . \n",

      "1) A series of serious crop failures in the late 19th century led to widespread famines on the subcontinent in which it is estimated that over 15 million people died . The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule . Later , under direct British rule , commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies , which took until the early 1900s to have an effect . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The British mandate in Palestine , where an Arab majority lived alongside a Jewish minority , presented the British with a similar problem to that of India . The matter was complicated by large numbers of Jewish refugees seeking to be admitted to Palestine following the Holocaust , while Arabs were opposed to the creation of a Jewish state . Frustrated by the intractability of the problem , attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence , Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve . The UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) A similar struggle began in India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence . Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar Conspiracy ensured that war - time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts . This led to tension , particularly in the Punjab region , where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre . In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre , between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy , and those who viewed it with revulsion . The subsequent Non-Co - Operation movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident , and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) When Russia invaded the Turkish Balkans in 1853 , fears of Russian dominance in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities . The ensuing Crimean War ( 1854 -- 56 ) , which involved new techniques of modern warfare , was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica and was a resounding defeat for Russia . The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades , with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia , Kazakhstan , and Turkmenistan . For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable , but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the Anglo - Russian Entente . The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo - Japanese War of 1904 -- 05 also limited its threat to the British . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) In July 1956 , Nasser unilaterally nationalised the Suez Canal . The response of Anthony Eden , who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister , was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on Egypt that would give Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal . Eden infuriated US President Dwight D. Eisenhower , by his lack of consultation , and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion . Another of Eisenhower 's concerns was the possibility of a wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side . Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the British pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency . Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives , UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces , and Eden resigned . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) In 1670 , Charles II incorporated by royal charter the Hudson 's Bay Company ( HBC ) , granting it a monopoly on the fur trade in the area known as Rupert 's Land , which would later form a large proportion of the Dominion of Canada . Forts and trading posts established by the HBC were frequently the subject of attacks by the French , who had established their own fur trading colony in adjacent New France . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In the Mediterranean , a guerrilla war waged by Greek Cypriots ended in 1960 leading to an independent Cyprus , with the UK retaining the military bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia . The Mediterranean islands of Malta and Gozo were amicably granted independence from the UK in 1964 and became the country of Malta , though the idea had been raised in 1955 of integration with Britain . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Although England trailed behind other European powers in establishing overseas colonies , it had been engaged during the 16th century in the settlement of Ireland with Protestants from England and Scotland , drawing on precedents dating back to the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169 . Several people who helped establish the Plantations of Ireland also played a part in the early colonisation of North America , particularly a group known as the West Country men . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) While the Suez Crisis caused British power in the Middle East to weaken , it did not collapse . Britain again deployed its armed forces to the region , intervening in Oman ( 1957 ) , Jordan ( 1958 ) and Kuwait ( 1961 ) , though on these occasions with American approval , as the new Prime Minister Harold Macmillan 's foreign policy was to remain firmly aligned with the United States . Britain maintained a military presence in the Middle East for another decade . On 16 January 1968 , a few weeks after the devaluation of the pound , Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his Defence Secretary Denis Healey announced that British troops would be withdrawn from major military bases East of Suez , which included the ones in the Middle East , and primarily from Malaysia and Singapore by the end of 1971 , instead of 1975 as earlier planned . By that time over 50,000 British military personnel were still stationed in the Far East , including 30,000 in Singapore . The British withdrew from Aden in 1967 , Bahrain in 1971 , and the Maldives in 1976 . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The last decades of the 19th century saw concerted political campaigns for Irish home rule . Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the Act of Union 1800 after the Irish Rebellion of 1798 , and had suffered a severe famine between 1845 and 1852 . Home rule was supported by the British Prime minister , William Gladstone , who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada 's footsteps as a Dominion within the empire , but his 1886 Home Rule bill was defeated in Parliament . Although the bill , if passed , would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation , many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or mark the beginning of the break - up of the empire . A second Home Rule bill was also defeated for similar reasons . A third bill was passed by Parliament in 1914 , but not implemented because of the outbreak of the First World War leading to the 1916 Easter Rising . \n",

      "\u001b[1mQuestion 84: are pure metals made of atoms or ions ?\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> The atoms of metallic substances are typically arranged in one of three common crystal structures , namely body - centered cubic ( bcc ) , face - centered cubic ( fcc ) , and hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) . In bcc , each atom is positioned at the center of a cube of eight others . In fcc and hcp , each atom is surrounded by twelve others , but the stacking of the layers differs . Some metals adopt different structures depending on the temperature . </P>\n",

      "1) Viscous flow near grain boundaries , for example , can give rise to internal slip , creep and fatigue in metals . It can also contribute to significant changes in the microstructure like grain growth and localized densification due to the elimination of intergranular porosity . Screw dislocations may slip in the direction of any lattice plane containing the dislocation , while the principal driving force for `` dislocation climb '' is the movement or diffusion of vacancies through a crystal lattice . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Alloys specially designed for highly demanding applications , such as jet engines , may contain more than ten elements . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The World Bank reports that China was the top importer of ores and metals in 2005 followed by the United States and Japan . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Some metals and metal alloys possess high structural strength per unit mass , making them useful materials for carrying large loads or resisting impact damage . Metal alloys can be engineered to have high resistance to shear , torque and deformation . However the same metal can also be vulnerable to fatigue damage through repeated use or from sudden stress failure when a load capacity is exceeded . The strength and resilience of metals has led to their frequent use in high - rise building and bridge construction , as well as most vehicles , many appliances , tools , pipes , non-illuminated signs and railroad tracks . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The thermal conductivity of metal is useful for containers to heat materials over a flame . Metal is also used for heat sinks to protect sensitive equipment from overheating . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The report authors observed that the metal stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground . They warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones , battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells are so low that unless future end - of - life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) The high reflectivity of some metals is important in the construction of mirrors , including precision astronomical instruments . This last property can also make metallic jewelry aesthetically appealing . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) Sulfide ores are not reduced directly to the metal but are roasted in air to convert them to oxides . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) In numismatics , coins in the past derived their value primarily from the precious metal content . Most modern currencies are fiat currency , allowing the coins to be made of base metal . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) The strength and resilience of metals has led to their frequent use in high - rise building and bridge construction , as well as most vehicles , many home appliances , tools , pipes , non-illuminated signs and railroad tracks . Precious metals were historically used as coinage . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> Active transport is the movement of molecules across a membrane from a region of their lower concentration to a region of their higher concentration -- in the direction against the concentration gradient . Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement . There are two types of active transport -- primary active transport that uses ATP , and secondary active transport that uses an electrochemical gradient . An example of active transport in human physiology is the uptake of glucose in the intestines . </P>\n",

      "1) In 1997 , Jens Christian Skou , a Danish physician received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research regarding the sodium - potassium pump \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Cotransporters can be classified as symporters and antiporters depending on whether the substances move in the same or opposite directions . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Rosenberg ( 1948 ) formulated the concept of active transport based on energetic considerations , but later it would be redefined . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) In August 1960 , in Prague , Robert K. Crane presented for the first time his discovery of the sodium - glucose cotransport as the mechanism for intestinal glucose absorption . Crane 's discovery of cotransport was the first ever proposal of flux coupling in biology . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Biologists distinguish two main types of endocytosis : pinocytosis and phagocytosis . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Additionally in plants , ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites . Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites . One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1 . This unique ABC transporter is found in Nicotiana tabacum BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors . NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant . Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization . Furthermore , it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules , which are toxic to the cell at high levels . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) In 1848 , the German physiologist Emil du Bois - Reymond suggested the possibility of active transport of substances across membranes . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) One category of cotransporters that is especially prominent in research regarding diabetes treatment is sodium glucose cotransporters . These transporters were discovered by scientists at that National Health Institute . These scientists had noticed a discrepancy in the absorption of glucose at different points in the kidney tubule of a rat . The gene was then discovered for intestinal glucose transport protein and linked to these membrane sodium glucose cotransport systems . The first of these membrane transport proteins was named SGLT1 followed by the discovery of SGLT2 . Robert Krane also played a prominent role in this field . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Exocytosis involves the removal of substances through the fusion of the outer cell membrane and a vesicle membrane An example of exocytosis would be the transmission of neurotransmitters across a synapse between brain cells . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) In plants , ABC transporters are often found within cell and organelle membranes , such as the mitochondria , chloroplast , and plasma membrane . There is evidence to support that plant ABC transporters play a direct role in pathogen response , phytohormone transport , and detoxification . Furthermore , certain plant ABC transporters may function in actively exporting volatile compounds and antimicrobial metabolites . \n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> Minuit is credited with purchasing the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans in exchange for traded goods valued at 60 guilders . According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley , Minuit conducted the transaction with Seyseys , chief of the Canarsees , who were only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for an island that was mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks . </P>\n",
      "\u001b[1mDocument url: \u001b[0mhttps://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Peter_Minuit&amp;oldid=845627939\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Minuit conducted politics in a measure of democracy in the colony during his time in New Netherland . He was highest judge in the colony , but in both civil and criminal affairs he was assisted by a council of five colonists . This advisory body would advise the director and jointly with him would develop , administer , and adjudicate a body of laws to help govern the colony . In addition there was a schout - fiscal , half - sheriff , half - attorney - general , and the customs officer . During Minuit 's administration , several mills were built , trade grew exponentially , and the population grew to almost 300 . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Peter Minuit was born sometime between 1580 and 1585 , into a Calvinist family that had moved from the city of Tournai ( presently part of Wallonia , Belgium ) in the Southern Netherlands , to Wesel in Germany , in order to avoid Spanish Catholic colonials , who were not favorably disposed toward Protestants . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) In 1631 , the Dutch West India Company ( WIC ) suspended Minuit from his post for reasons that are unclear , but probably for ( perhaps unintentionally ) abetting the landowning patroons who were engaging in illegal fur trade and otherwise enriching themselves against the interests and orders of the West India Company . He arrived back in Europe in August 1632 to explain his actions , but was dismissed and was succeeded as director by Wouter van Twiller . It is possible that Minuit had become the victim of the internal disputes over the rights that the board of directors had given to the patroons . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) His father , Johan , died in 1609 and Peter took over management of the household and his father 's business . Peter had a good reputation in Wesel , attested by the fact that he was several times appointed a guardian . He also assisted the poor during the Spanish occupation of 1614 -- 1619 . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) According to researchers at the National Library of the Netherlands , `` The original inhabitants of the area were unfamiliar with the European notions and definitions of ownership rights . For the Indians , water , air and land could not be traded . Such exchanges would also be difficult in practical terms because many groups migrated between their summer and winter quarters . It can be concluded that both parties probably went home with totally different interpretations of the sales agreement . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "6)Peter Minuit - wikipedia \n",
      "\n",
      "7) By 1624 , the city was in an economic decline and in 1625 , he had left Wesel and like others , went to Holland . At first , Gertrude went to stay with her relatives in Cleve . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) A contemporary purchase of rights in nearby Staten Island , to which Minuit also was party , involved duffel cloth , iron kettles , axe heads , hoes , wampum , drilling awls , `` Jew 's harps '' , and `` diverse other wares '' . `` If similar trade goods were involved in the Manhattan arrangement '' , Burrows and Wallace surmise , `` then the Dutch were engaged in high - end technology transfer , handing over equipment of enormous usefulness in tasks ranging from clearing land to drilling wampum . '' \n",
      "\n",
      "9) The figure of 60 guilders comes from a letter by a representative of the Dutch States - General and member of the board of the Dutch West India Company , Pieter Janszoon Schagen , to the States - General in November 1626 . In 1846 , New York historian John Romeyn Brodhead converted the figure of Fl 60 ( or 60 guilders ) to US $ 23 . The popular account rounds this off to $24 . By 2006 sixty guilders in 1626 was worth approximately $1,000 in current dollars , according to the Institute for Social History of Amsterdam . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Minuit and his family joined the Dutch West India Company , probably in the mid-1620s , and was sent to New Netherland in 1625 to search for tradable goods other than the animal pelts that then were the major product coming from New Netherland . He returned in the same year , and in 1626 was appointed the new director of New Netherland , taking over from Willem Verhulst . He sailed to North America and arrived in the colony on May 4 , 1626 . \n",

      "1) All episodes aside from the finales have the following format , with some minor variations to the application of the format : \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Season five brought back Joshua Hibbard and Jason Clay Dunn from season three , along with eight other pairs of rivals . The winner 's worst selection did not return for season five . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) First , there is a Flash Challenge that will be evaluated based on how well an artist met the skill of the week . Some Flash Challenges involve tattooing , but typically , flash challenges do not incorporate the act of tattooing ; but , instead , will require a non-related artistic skill ( i.e. painting , hair cutting , etching , burning , etc . ) The winner of the flash challenge wins the right to select their own human canvas in the elimination challenge , and , as of season two , pair up the other contestants with their human canvases . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Season four introduced the elimination challenge winner 's selection , where the challenge winner picks an artist for elimination from his / her perspective . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Season three introduced the human canvas jury , in which the human canvases review each other 's tattoos and nominate for elimination the artist who did the worst piece . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Musician Dave Navarro and tattoo artists Chris Núñez and Oliver Peck are the show 's primary judges ; Dave and Chris have appeared in all episodes to date ; however Oliver missed two episodes of season nine as he was having surgery after a heart attack . Some episodes incorporate a fourth guest judge , usually a well - known tattoo artist who has knowledge or reputation in the style of tattoo ( such as New School , Traditional , Japanese , Portrait , Black and Gray , etc . ) chosen for the week 's elimination challenge . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) There have been various standalone holiday and special event themed episodes made that do not follow the series seasons . They have typically followed an upcoming or recently passed holiday . These episodes feature previous Ink Master contestants competing for smaller cash prizes . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) For the finale of season one , the final challenge was a marathon tattooing of up to 18 hours . The season two finale did not share this format , and instead consisted of each of the three finalists meeting with his or her respective canvas for four six - hour sessions to create a final piece . This final piece did not require a specific tattoo genre or location for the artist to tattoo . Instead , the artists were able to choose those aspects for themselves , and the only restriction they faced was a time limit . The season three finale followed a similar format to the season two finale , but the artists were allowed five seven - hour sessions for a cumulative 35 - hour master canvas tattoo . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) After the Flash Challenge comes the Elimination Challenge , a further test of the skill of the week on a human canvas , typically incorporating a prominent style of tattooing . Once the contestants are paired up with their canvases , they are given the day to consult with their assignment . The next day , each contestant is given four to six hours to tattoo their design . Once completed , the contestants meet as a group with the judges and are critiqued one by one . The contestants then are dismissed , with four later being called back . The four typically represent a top two and bottom two for the week , though this breakdown can change . At the end of each episode , a winner is typically declared and one contestant is eliminated . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Ink Master licensed a Dutch / Belgian edition called Ink Master : Meesters van de Lage Landen ( Masters of the Low Countries ) to Spike NL in 2017 . The format remains largely intact , filming takes place mainly around Amsterdam . The winner of the first season of this edition was the Belgian contestant `` Djoels '' \n",

      "\u001b[1mTrue Answer: \u001b[0m<P> The majority of the movie was shot on location in Seattle , Washington although portions were filmed in downtown Vancouver . The TV station in the movie , KQMO , was actually real - life Seattle TV station KOMO - TV ( the KOMO logo was altered on the set of KOMO 4 News and on several of KOMO 's news vehicles , in addition to a few mic flags ) . </P>\n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Several KOMO personalities make cameo appearances ; among them are longtime anchors Dan Lewis and Margo Myers ( the latter moved to KIRO - TV in January 2005 ) , weather anchor and Front Runners host Steve Pool , and weekend weather anchor Theron Zahn . Other KOMO personalities who made brief cameo appearances include People Helper John Sharify , and reporter Michelle Esteban . \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Lanie Kerrigan ( Angelina Jolie ) , a successful reporter for a Seattle television station , interviews a self - proclaimed prophet , Jack ( Tony Shalhoub ) , to find out if he really can predict football scores . Instead , Prophet Jack not only predicts the football score , and that it would hail the next day , but also that she would die in seven days , meaning the following Thursday . When his first two prophecies turn out to be correct , Kerrigan panics and again meets with Jack , asking him for another prophecy so that she can prove it wrong , which would imply uncertainty of her death . Jack tells her that there will be a relatively significant earthquake in San Francisco at 9 : 06 am ; she hopes that it will be wrong but again it also becomes reality . Now Lanie becomes sure of her upcoming death and is forced to reevaluate her life . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Lanie - unconcerned with Jack 's prophecy - interviews her idol , famous media personality Deborah Connors ( Stockard Channing ) . Lanie realizes how petty the opening questions are and shares a heartfelt moment with Deborah live on air . The interview receives huge ratings . The network immediately offers her a position , but Lanie declines , realizing that she wants a life with Pete in Seattle . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Pete meets Jack and tells him how wrong he is , as Lanie got the job which Jack foretold she would not get . But Jack explains that he was right as Lanie will never be able to get the job as she 'll die before it begins . He again gives a prophecy of the death of a famous former baseball player in a plane crash . Pete receives the news of the death of the baseball player as foretold by Jack , and tries to call Lanie to warn her . When he can not reach her , he flies to New York . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Jolie 's performance in the film earned her a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) As of October 17 , 2014 , based on 121 reviews collected by the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , Life or Something Like It has received an overall rating average of 28 % , with an average score of 4.5 out of 10 . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Lanie implements Pete 's advice ; she moves in with Pete for a day , and he introduces her to his son Tommy ( Jesse James Rutherford ) , who lives with his mother , and they spend a whole day together with Tommy . That night they sleep together for the second time . The next day Lanie receives an opportunity for a job she always dreamed of in New York . She asks Pete to come with her , but he declines and tells her that her appetite for success and fame will never end . Lanie sadly leaves for New York . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The remainder of the storyline - which runs for the week of the prophecy - revolves around her attempts at introspection . She seeks consolation in her famous baseball player boyfriend Cal Cooper ( Christian Kane ) , and in her family , but finds little there . Her lifelong ambition , that of appearing on network television , begins to look like a distant dream . In her desperation , she commits professional blunders , but ends up finding support in an unlikely source : her archenemy , the cameraman Pete Scanlon ( Edward Burns ) , with whom she once had casual sex . He introduces her to a new approach to life ; to live every moment of her life and to do whatever she always wanted to do . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Additionally , Vancouver news anchors Pamela Martin and Jill Krop , at the time both employed with BCTV , appeared briefly in scenes shot in the BCTV studios . \n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswers by DPR Retriver:\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Although the ' footprint ' of a bungalow is often a simple rectangle , any foundation is theoretically possible . For bungalows with brick walls , the windows are often positioned high , and are close to the roof . This architectural technique avoids the need for special arches or lintels to support the brick wall above the windows . However , in two - story homes , there is no choice but to continue the brick wall above the window ( second - story windows may be positioned high and close to the roof . ) \n",
      "\n",
      "2) True bungalows do not use the attic . Because the attic is not used , the roof pitch can be quite shallow , constrained only by snow load considerations . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The American Craftsman bungalow typified the styles of the American Arts and Crafts movement , with common features usually including low - pitched roof lines on a gabled or hipped roof , deeply overhanging eaves , exposed rafters or decorative brackets under the eaves , and a front porch or veranda beneath an extension of the main roof . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) A bungalow with loft has a second - storey loft . The loft may be extra space over the garage . It is often space to the side of a great room with a vaulted ceiling area . The building is still classified and marketed as a bungalow with loft because the main living areas of the house are on one floor . All the convenience of single - floor living still applies and the loft is not expected to be accessed on a daily basis . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Bungalows are very convenient for the homeowner in that all living areas are on a single - story and there are no stairs between living areas . A bungalow is well suited to persons with impaired mobility , such as the elderly or those in wheelchairs . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) There are numerous examples of Arts and Crafts bungalows built from 1910 to 1925 in the metro - Detroit area , including Royal Oak , Pleasant Ridge , Hazel Park , Highland Park and Ferndale . Keeping in line with the principles of the Arts and Crafts movement , the bungalows were constructed using local building materials . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) On a per unit area basis ( e.g. per square meter or per square foot ) , bungalows are more expensive to construct than two - story houses , because a larger foundation and roof area is required for the same living area . The larger foundation will often translate into larger lot size requirements , as well . Due to this , bungalows are typically fully detached from other buildings and do not share a common foundation or party wall : if the homeowner can afford the extra expense of a bungalow relative to a two - story house , they can typically afford to be fully detached as well . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) A ranch bungalow is a bungalow organized so that bedrooms are on one side and `` public '' areas ( kitchen , living / dining / family rooms ) are on the other side . If there is an attached garage , the garage is on the public side of the building so that a direct entrance is possible , when this is allowed by legislation . On narrower lots , public areas are at the front of the building and such an organization is typically not called a `` ranch bungalow '' . Such buildings are often smaller and have only two bedrooms in the back as required . \n",
      "\n",
      "9) A raised bungalow is one in which the basement is partially above ground . The benefit is that more light can enter the basement with above ground windows in the basement . A raised bungalow typically has a foyer at ground level that is halfway between the first floor and the basement . Thus further has the advantage of creating a foyer with a very high ceiling without the expense of raising the roof or creating a skylight . Raised bungalows often have the garage in the basement . Because the basement is not that deep , and the ground must slope downwards away from the building , the slope of the driveway is quite shallow . This avoids the disadvantage of steep driveways found in most other basement garages . Bungalows without basements can still be raised , but the advantages of raising the bungalow are much less . \n",
      "\n",
      "10) Canada uses the definition of bungalow to mean a single - family dwelling that is one storey high . \n",

      "2) West Germany would go on to defeat Uruguay in the third - place game , 1 -- 0 . \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Italy led for the majority of the match , after Roberto Boninsegna scored in the 8th minute . Germany 's Franz Beckenbauer dislocated his shoulder after being fouled , but stayed on the field carrying his dislocated arm in a sling , as his side had already used their two permitted substitutions . \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Defender Karl - Heinz Schnellinger equalized for West Germany during injury time at the end of the second half . German television commentator Ernst Huberty exclaimed `` Schnellinger , of all people ! '' ( in German : `` Schnellinger ! Ausgerechnet Schnellinger ! '' ) , since Schnellinger played in Italy 's professional football league , Serie A , at A.C. Milan ( for whom he had never scored ) and previously for A.S. Roma and A.C. Mantova . It was also his first and only goal in 47 matches for the national team . The second half ended with the scores deadlocked at 1 -- 1 , and at this point the match became a battle of endurance during the two periods of extra time . \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Italy , after having expended a great amount of energy in winning the hard - fought match , were roundly defeated by Brazil in the Final 4 -- 1 . Brazil thus became the first team to win three world football championships . \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Gerd Müller put Germany ahead in the 94th minute , but Tarcisio Burgnich tied it back up four minutes later and Luigi Riva put the Italians back in front . Gerd Müller scored again for West Germany to tie the score at 3 -- 3 . Yet , as television cameras were still replaying Müller 's goal , Italy 's Gianni Rivera scored the game - winning goal in the 111th minute . Being left unmarked near the penalty area , Rivera connected a fine cross made by Boninsegna , clinching the victory for Italy at 4 -- 3 . \n",
      "\n",
      "7) A monument commemorating this match was added to front of the Azteca . On a plaque the following sentence is engraved : El Estadio Azteca rinde homenaje a las selecciones de : Italia ( 4 ) y Alemania ( 3 ) protagonistas en el Mundial de 1970 , del `` Partido del Siglo '' 17 de junio de 1970 . English : The Azteca Stadium pays homage to the National Teams of Italy ( 4 ) and Germany ( 3 ) , who starred in the 1970 FIFA World Cup , the `` Game of the Century '' . 17 June 1970 . \n",
      "\n",
      "8) The semi-final of the 1970 FIFA World Cup between Italy and West Germany is known as the `` Game of the Century '' ( Spanish : Partido del Siglo ; Italian : Partita del secolo ; German : Jahrhundertspiel ) . It was played on 17 June 1970 at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City . Italy won 4 -- 3 after five goals were scored in extra time , a record number of scored goals during any 2x15 minute extra time during a FIFA World Cup game . The record is still standing after the 2018 World Cup . Four goals in extra time were scored in the 1982 semifinal between West Germany and France . \n",
